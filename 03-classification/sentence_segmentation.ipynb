       " 'My husband and I were looking to hold a small, intimate solemnisation together with lunch for 10 pax. Fulinmen NSRCC was the only restaurant that offered us a private room for this, with no extra venue charges or minimum spending. We also loved the scenic environment of the restaurant, overlooking the spacious golf course. \\nRight from our first recce visit, Ruel has been easy-going and extremely helpful. He is very responsive over text to any questions I have, and goes out of his way to fulfill some of my requests (e.g. having access to the room from 10am onwards for preparations). On the evening before my solemnisation lunch, he even took the liberty to send photographs of the room setup, to assure me that everything is ready and in place (as attached). \\nOn the day of the solemnisation, Ruel was in the private room at all times, together with a helper. Once we arrived, he served us coffee and tea, and was on standby to offer help whenever he can. Once he saw that the solemnisation was wrapping up, he also took the initiative to start getting the dishes ready for service. The entire event flow was seamless due to his attention to detail. Of course, the lunch proceeded smoothly. Each dish in the 6-course meal was individually plated, and every dish was delicious! We especially enjoyed the lotus leaf rice, which was packed with so many ingredients and super satisfying! For the dessert, the portions of peach resin was super generous too. Ruel also took the effort to check whether each of us wanted the dessert warm or chilled.\\nOverall, it was a super pleasant experience with Ruel and his team. My husband and I are super glad we chose to celebrate our special day at Fulinmen NSRCC, and our family has nothing but praises for the food and service as well! Highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion, especially for brides-to-be looking for a fuss-free experience for your banquet/solemnisation!',\n",
