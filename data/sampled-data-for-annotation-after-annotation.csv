So we ordered at the bar and were asked to pay immediately - this was not a take away order - so another thumbs down 

As mentioned; coffee was great. The lemonades could have been anything as there was little taste of lemon, Probably better off with tap water.   Very dark and no ambience to the place.

Spize @ River Valley,"Mediterranean, Asian",loweddie,3,"Visited Spize RV on 21/10/18 2:15am. Would like to feedback a negative experience I had. One of the staff took down my order and when the food was served. One of the items was wrong. Upon checking back with the staff. He claimed that he wrote down Nasi Goreng Pattaya while I have asked for Maggie Goreng pattaya. When I tried to ask for a change. He claimed that the order was done and he clearly wrote down N G Pattaya. My Wife and I were sure that I have said Maggie Goreng Pattaya. What was disappointing is not that the orders was wrong with but the staff who unapologetic said that he wrote down Nasi Goreng clearly. My point is what I ordered is not what he wrote. And such service standard is really unacceptable. Been to Spize RV couple of times, never had any issues before and this negative experience will really prevent me from heading there again. 

I'm not gonna mentioned any names. Just wish to highlight this to the management to educate the correct service attitude. Throughout the whole commotion.

Chikuyotei Dining,"Japanese, Sushi",pigkiller777,2,"The omakase here was great, in fact, one of the best I’ve had in Singapore but our lunch was unceremoniously ruined when I ordered a serving of 180ml of sake, and they presented it to me in an unhygienic way, spilling it purposely out of the sake glass and into the wooden box holding the glass. After I went home, I went to check online what that was about. 

Apparently it’s a Japanese custom to drink it this way. But it’s a style that’s increasingly disapproved in Japan due to hygiene reasons and how people almost always get shortchanged on the quantity of sake they had paid for. 

Now that might have been just a cultural preference that I didn’t take to, and I can’t fault the restaurant for practicing it (although it would have been nice if the waitress asked if I wanted the normal way or that traditional Japanese way). 

The problem I have is, I saw the waitress dip her finger into my sake! Yes. She directly dipped her finger into the drink. What’s worse was that she had a band-aid bandage on her finger. Which indicates she could have had blood spilling out of a wound before it was bandaged. 

The fine meal was marred by this strange departure from hygiene. I’d have given the restaurant four stars if this sake fiasco hadn’t occurred.",-1,-1

My severest criticism and reason for the title is that for a restaurant with as fine a selection of wines as this, to serve a 1995 Margaux wine in the bottle, rotating it with a flourish to avoid dribbling and thoroughly mixing all of the leaves in the process, just highlighted that things French did not extend beyond the decor, kitchen, the manager’s stripey shirt and beret

Wild Rocket @ Mount Emily,"Asian, Fusion",AntarcticaTraveller,2,"I will suggest to Mr Low to relook/review his dishes and pricing policy before Wild Rocket goes the way of some restaurants in Singapore.

There are so many ""adds"" and ""adds"" and ""adds"" to each dish in the tasting menu. I really cannot understand why restaurants do that. It is petty. Charge one price and leave it as that. I can understand if the ""add"" is for truffles or expensive stuff, but it is not the case here. I left the restaurant unfulfilled. If a restaurant charges top price, I expect top rate service. Again, this is not the case here. Napkin dropped on the floor was picked up and folded and returned to us (and it was not changed). Side plates had to be requested. Service standard was merely perfunctory and not enthusiastic. And I can go on  My experiences at Wild Rocket were pretty many good years ago. It was mostly full-house at that time. The night I went, it was rather cold and is a sad place. Until Mr Low starts accepting that he has lost his magic and needs to do something about it, I will not be back.

Jacob's Cafe,"Cafe, European",lleonard13,1,"Service was slow. Staff recommended their pork knuckle and was told that it will take between 20 to 25 mins for it to be served. 
We went ahead with their suggestion and it took more than 45 mins for them to serve. 
Staff took no initiative to follow-up and inform us about the delay.
When we feedback to them about the delay, staff asked if we wanted to order soup while waiting.. Isit on the house or at our own expense? Staff was not clear about this and at the end of service, we were given Jacob's namecard and told to order in advance in future as the restaurant was overwhelmed with orders.

Well Jacob's Cafe, when we ordered, your restaurant was not full house or crowded. Please acknowledge your mistakes and take some responsibility for the mistakes that you made.
We followed your recommendation and agreed to wait for 20 to 25 mins since you made it clear to us. You did not take any initiative to inform us of the delay.
To top it off, you are being completely illogical by asking guest to order a dish in advance that we have never tried, and it was based on your recommendation.
Your service recovery is ridiculous and no, you did not bother to make things right. Being defensive is a no-no when you clearly neglected our orders.
Well, they say, getting new customers is hard, but keeping them is harder. You just lost one today.
Finally, your recommendation is truly mediocre.

Akashi Japanese Restaurant,$$ - $$$,filleenmonde,3,"Akashi used to be one of my favourite Japanese restaurants in Singapore, so it saddens me to share that the level of service has deteriorated to the point where waitresses can be heard telling one another loudly in Mandarin not to serve hot towels to a new group of foreigners who had just been seated at the counter.

For me, I was also surprised that I had to ask for hot towels and the waitress was reluctant and dangled it across the restaurant for me out of a pair of tongs direct from the heater without even a tray or holder. When I asked for the bamboo tray, she was again reluctant and said that they don't provide hot towels anymore to customers at tables, and serve them only to customers at the counter. Any customer who wants a towel and holder would need to ask for it.

That then turned out to be untrue after I overheard the waitresses conversation about the customers at the counter. I decided to question a few to sort their stories and some then told me that the boss/management has decided that no hot towels should be served,

I may be going on about hot towels here but it is not about it. It is a very small yet thoughtful part of the Japanese food service that Akashi has decided to remove from their service for customers although we are still paying a premium for the food and service. It is so at odds with my experience with and expectations of Akashi in the past that this penny-wise policy makes dining there unpleasant. 

Oh, and to find out that a friend's friend received great, personal service from the owner recently (hot towels at beginning and end of food service) just makes the discrimination and experience worse.",0,0

PX Hainanese Chicken Rice,"Chinese, Fast food",akvan2015,3,"Today I for the very first time visited the stall at T4 Changi airport just to see what kind of meal I would be savoring.
First of all just let me tell you that I work for a company at the airport and was in uniform with my staff ID.
This stall does not give any staff discount  and neither was I asked. I ordered a regular dish of chicken rice and it came with a few miserable pieces of chicken, two thinly slices of cucumber and cold soup which was full of sodium.You can literally feel it in your mouth when you feel very dry due to this content.
At 4.80 cents this is a rip off when you can get the same dish at one of our regular coffee shops for half or slightly less than the 4.80 cents rubbish.
What is so good about this dish  “NOTHING”
Just to add to the discount, most of the other stalls do. The rating given has nothing to do with the discount but to the taste. Cold rice and if this is the case why mislead the public with the photo on the wall which looks so different with good slices of chicken etc.
NTUC I guess runs this place and the only discount you get is about 5 to maybe 10 percent.
Well to let all know , this dish is over priced miserable and not worth consuming at all.

Obviously they were out of bread, because breakfast time was almost over. I wouldn’t have had a problem with that, if they would have just apologized for it and told me that there was no more bread and maybe offer me something else instead, but they obviously tried to hide the fact and hoped I wouldn’t realize that something was missing. Especially after I had another glance at the menu, I saw that they serve sandwiches for lunch with a different kind of bread. After realizing that they could have just offered me a different kind of bread I was really disappointed how they serve their customers, especially regarding the really high prices and the more than average food.

Once seated, we were served by a waiter (Caucasian) who asked us for the type of water we would like to have. We requested for warm water and he poured some boiling water into our cups. We thought that he would return with some cold water to balance out the temperature of the water, but to our shock, he did not. There is a big difference between warm and boiling water, and it was appalling that a restaurant would believe it is alright for guests to drink boiling water. Zero common sense and tactfulness.

Thankfully, a female waitress (Filipina) we provided feedback to was quick to fix this. Kudos to her, she was pleasant and polite throughout the meal.

Subsequently, I noticed that there was a strand of hair in my water. When I informed a waiter (Indian) about it, he gave a blank look, said nothing, and just took the cup away to replace it. There was not even a basic ‘sorry’ nor any word spoken from the moment he took the cup away to when he returned it. Zero courtesy, zero professionalism. Not the kind of service you would expect from a restaurant like this.

The key observation was that staff at the entrance, as well as the female waitresses tending to guests at the dining table, appeared more professional and polite.

Mathieu has welcomed us almost immediately after we were on table, Anthony taking care of us the whole time. 

As soon as the food arrived, the party was on !
A deep, complex yet very reassuring taste on the palet.
A true « French Cuisine ». Nothing over fancy, and the Truffle rain was absolutely a moment to enjoy (everyone’s phone was OUT !)

A real Service « à la française », here for you but not over pressing. 
Wine has been beautifully paired by Anthony, this makes a massive difference !

And to make everything more pleasant, we all agreed when the bill came that, for a Christmas dinner, it was more than worth it !

Félicitations et Merci !

We’ll be back !

The experience really did not leave a pleasant taste in my mouth. Visit at your own peril.",-1,-1
