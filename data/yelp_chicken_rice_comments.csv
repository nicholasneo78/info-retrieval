Margot C.,5,2020-03-19,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner while in Singapore and we were so happy we did. We ordered chilli crab, mantou buns, and cereal prawns. We loved everything and had a delicious meal.We got the dungeness crab, which I highly recommend because it had a ton of sweet crab meat. It went really well with the chilli sauce. You must also get the mantou buns to sop up some of the sauce. They are deep fried, slightly sweet bread rolls that are absolutely delicious. I highly recommend getting both of these if you come here. We had chilli crab at a hawker center and enjoyed it, but preferred it with the dungeness crab we got here to the mud crab at the hawker center.The cereal prawns were also delicious. They come butterflied in a crispy cereal coating, that has seasonings like chili and curry leaves in it. They are fairly mild in flavor, but were delicious. I highly recommend also getting these.Service wasn't overly friendly but was fairly quick. The place is definitely more expensive than a hawker center will be, but not outrageously expensive. I would recommend coming here if you're looking for good chilli crab in a higher end place.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Kira N.,4,2020-02-10,"196 SGD (Singapore Dollar) for some crab and fish seems like we were gettin' played by our Singaporean brothas and sistuhs, but no, we just had no idea what the hell we were ordering. Just look at the sgd/gram and order the amount of grams u want to pay, or that will satisfy ur belly. Don't order an entire fish & crab if u don't want to spend close to 200 SGD!!I must admit, the soon hock fish was phenomenal! Cooked to perfection in that wow, I can't believe garlic ever tasted this good sauce!! They don't make fish like THIS in the states! The crab was delicious, but ma & pa makes me better crab, so gotta knock off a star. There was ample supply of crab meat & the meat itself was sturdy & full of flavor, but we didn't really enjoy the famous Singapore chili sauce that the crab was drenched in. Service was nice as this was a super messy meal and our server provided us with a good supply of napkins and wet wipes. If u don't want to smell like u've just rolled in some fine fish and crab, u can wash ur hands at the sink inside the restaurant when u're all fished and crabbed out! This is a seafood chain in Singapore, and unless u've dreamt of visiting Singapore just to get a taste of the seafood here, then just walk on by my friend, cuz u can have the same quality tasting seafood for a better price point at one of the many food hawkers around town!! Happy hawking!!!","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Diane C.,2,2019-11-19,"Holy cow! Totally wish we stuck with the street food and hawker stands. Waited all day to come try Jumbo Seafood for dinner and was so disappointed! The whole dining experience was meh. There was only one person taking orders, you can't just ask anyone to take your order or grab the server, you'd just get brushed off. There were 4.5 of us dining, 4 adults and a child. We ordered the chili crab, Chinese broccoli, small order of fried rice, small order of noodles and 4 bamboo clams which was a little more than we were capable of eating. Nothing really wow'ed us, we were really underwhelmed especially for the price we paid. Honestly, every hawker stand we tried, the food was SO good! Being that this was the most expensive meal of our trip, we were slightly bitter and disappointed.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Steve H.,5,2019-12-08,"Jumbo seafood is the place to go for crabs. My parents actually went there three out of the four days that we were in Singapore. With all the food choices, that's a big endorsement. Unfortunately, they were out of the Alaskan crab the night that I went, but we opted for Dungeness crabs and they were still delicious. Everybody raves about the chili crab, but to me the salted egg crab was slightly better, but honestly, you can't go wrong with either choice. The chili crab has a thick sauce and a light heat that lingers. The salted egg is a little dryer but the saltiness goes great with the crab. The fried rice was also a winner but the crabs are why you come here. Sure, it's a little pricey, but it's well worth it. You can't come to Singapore without stopping by a Jumbo Seafood location to grab some crabs.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Lan T.,4,2019-08-21,"During my 3 days stay in Singapore in March of 2019, I cannot not try the Singapore Award Winning Chilly Crab here!! I was sooo excited to come, and I have to say, by far, it is the best crab I've ever had in my life!!The sauce of the crab was soupy and you can dip with bread or donut. I just ate it by itself, and I finished the whole crab plus all the sauce!! Didn't waste any tiny bit!! Well, I did say it was the best crab of my life!!! During the past 5 months, I have tried a couple of Malaysian and Chinese restaurants in the Northeast and haven't found anything that was close to this!! I should have bought the Chilly Crab seasoning that the restaurant also sells!!My bf didn't want to try any of my crab, because he heard from many people who got sick with food in Asia, and he was extremely careful! I didn't care because I was born and raised in Asia for 19 years before I came to the states!! He ordered a seafood clay pot instead, which looked boring haha! Well, that's his choice and nothing outside of the expectation!!!But it is due to this disk that I am taking off a star!! He got very very sick after this disk! I am not sure if some of the fish cake that he got was old or he was just not used to the food, but he started going to the bathroom twice before I even finished my meal!! OMG, poor guy!!!We stayed at the Marina Bay and he almost didn't make it back to the hotel! That was his experience in Asia: didn't get sick in a third world country, Vietnam, eating all the street food, but yet, got sick in a restaurant in Singapore, and it was not cheap! The bill came around $130 Singapore dollars! I know it was because of my chilly crab! His disk wasn't that expensive. I still love my chilly crab and want to come back to Singapore for this, but next time, my bf for sure will just watch me eat!!!","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Kevin C.,4,2019-08-19,"A Singapore institution that never disappoints! Situated on the shores of the River, this beautiful setting in a warm Singapore evening watching the people cruise by.We started with a squid appetizer followed by Pepper Crab and Chili Crab.  Crab comes with amazing sauce that cannot be described. Perfect little dough balls for mopping up the extra sauce. Love this place.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Prima S.,4,2020-03-08,"I was recommended this restaurant by someone who grew up in Singapore, so I had to trust their recommendation!I highly recommend purchasing the Klook voucher before you come here as the food is quite expensive here. I ordered a chilli crab, and while it was absolutely delicious, it would cost me about 100 SGD if I had not purchased the Klook voucher.I came here for lunch and since I was here on my own, it took about 20 minutes to get a seat without a reservation. They asked if I minded sharing a table with another party, and I said no because I knew I would get seated sooner. I was seated next to a girl about my age and her mother, so it was all pleasant.I ordered the smallest size chilli crab and used my hands to break into the crab, along with the tools they provided to crack the shell. I noticed some other people were provided with gloves, and I think it's not fair that they did not even mention that they had gloves available. Maybe this would be something I'd be aware of if I ate more messy seafood or if I were a Singapore local?Big note: They will offer you peanuts and tea as if they don't cost extra, but they do!! So if you're trying to save some money, refuse the peanuts and tea. Just get some water (though that still costs extra regardless of choosing bottled or tap water).Another note: They don't have napkins or anything at the table, so if you need wet napkins, definitely call someone over to provide you with some. You will definitely need wet wipes because chilli crab gets messy.Anyway, the chilli crab was very delicious; I basically devoured the chilli sauce and the crab was yummy too. The DIY breaking into the crab was fun but super messy. I'd probably be happy with having any seafood with the chilli sauce, but without the mess.Since I am just one person, I wasn't able to try any of the other delicious items they have. I hope I'll be back here with some friends and try the cereal prawns!","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Yi Z.,5,2019-05-03,"I am aware that Jumbo Seafood is a total tourist trap and that prices are high. That said, I was taken to a ""non-touristy"" chilli crab spot by someone who lived in Singapore previously and did not enjoy the crab at all. Since this was his first trip to Singapore, I figured why not go with Jumbo. I made a reservation for prime dinner time about 45 days in advance. You don't need to book that far ahead but you do need to book early.Since it was only the two of us, we didn't want to order too many items. We ended up getting:-Chilli crab (OMG, so good. So messy. So much fun. We ate in silence as we concentrated on getting all the crab meat out. I may have flung some crab onto the glass window next to where we were sitting. Oops!)-Fried buns (Perfect for soaking up the chilli sauce).-Cereal Prawns (Skip! Do not believe the hype, it was not worth it).We were in an out within an hour and were very satisfied with our seafood feast.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Rita K.,2,2019-04-05,"Underwhelmed by the flavors and quality of the foods here. We arrived here on a Friday evening close to 8PM... we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table of 2. The restaurant was packed and there were people waiting outside. They provided waters and chairs for those waiting. The restaurant is along the riverside which provided a nice view and very close to Clarke Quay center. We were seated at a large table with other groups of 2. It took awhile for the waiter to come by and take our orders; one of the customers had to flag the waiter down. We were provided tea and peanuts which we did not know cost additional. If we had known we would have skipped on the peanuts. We ordered the chili crab and pepper crab, along with fried rice and 2 buns. I don't know why my fiance thought it was a great idea to order 2 crab for just us 2. The foods came out very slowly... and it did not make sense. The ones who ordered last got their foods first. It took about 20 more minutes until our foods came out. The chili crab sauce was not good... It had a fishy taste to it and the crab meat was stuck on the shell; might have been overcooked. The fried rice with fried fish chunks were tasty though! The pepper crab came out way too late... by the time the rest of the table left our pepper crab finally came and we were too full. We ate it anyways... the flavors were odd. I didn't enjoy the flavors too much.At the end of the dinner I felt nauseous and had to go back to hotel. Something about the flavors made me nauseous. Total came out around $150 USD. Expensive! Napkins were non-existent. We asked for some but were ignored.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Lyssa A.,5,2019-03-16,"Came for the chili crab and was NOT disappointed. This stuff is so good and a cant miss in Singapore. I had found jumbo seafood on a list of best chili crab and had that recommendation seconded by a local so I couldn't say no! One chili crab is about the right size for two people and do no miss the bao buns on the side to soak up all that delicious chili crab sauce. Also prepared go get messy digging in! We had just a side of broccoli with the crab and honestly were so stuffed we didn't need any other sides. The wait was long but they take your name and number and Clarke Quay is a great place to walk around, so just expect it to take a little time for your turn!","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
West C.,1,2020-01-03,"Someone at the hotelWhere I am staying recommended this restaurant. After a walk in Chinatown we decided to come here. We got seated right away and we ordered the Alaska King Crab.1.3 kg ( half of the full crab ) about 200 SGD and we got the seafood noodles. The sauce for the Chili Alaska King crab tasted like ketchup and was a little bit spicy not what I was expecting.Service was also very disappointing, workers were rushing us to pay the bill even before we started to eat. Felt like we were been hustled, peanuts that we did not ask for and was put in our table 2 SGD in the bill, bread rolls that I didn't even touch also put in the bill, at least ask the guest if they want it instead of putting it on the table and charging for it. I would not Recommend this place, way better other places in Singapore to have chili crabs .","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Victoria E.,4,2018-08-02,"Salted egg coated food. That's what this place is all about. My colleagues and I came here for dinner. None of us live here as it's super expensive to dine without expense account. The crab was ginormous. We ordered the set menu which is always the best. 9 of us, $100 a person. Totally worth it.Salted egg shrink and fish skin fried. Very Singaporean and very cool. Salted egg coated crab and pepper crab two way. Delicious. Great view if you were to sit outside as it's right by the bay. Grab home - as in, using your Grab app (Uber is no longer allowed since April in Singapore or Malaysia, good riddance if you ask me) and you should find a car sharing service nearby.I do love me some Singapore!","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Julia C.,3,2018-12-26,"I really don't get the hype. A single chili crab was 88 SGD, which is about $65. For that kind of money, I could go to an AYCE buffet in Vegas and get unlimited crab legs. The flavor is pretty mediocre too. We ordered pea sprouts, but they were the baby kind, not the tastier, more mature kind. And some sort of scallops in taro which I could have done without. Actually I could have done without the whole meal. There are two branches of the same restaurant within walking distance of each other -- make sure you go to the right one. Reservations recommended. This place gets busy.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
David K.,5,2018-12-21,"A must-visit for visitors to Singapore, Jumbo Seafood is the place to come for the classic Singaporean dish of chili crab! It's messy (wear a bib!), it's spicy, it's sweet--it actually reminds me of the classic Chinese tomato and egg dish (perhaps not surprising since the sauce contains both these ingredients)! The cracked pieces of crab are delicious, and the sauce is perfect over some rice or with some fried, crispy mantou on the side!But chili crab isn't the only thing to get here--the vegetables stir-fried with sambal were full of shrimpy goodness, the seafood fried rice was a simple classic, and the scallops in fried yam rings were a surprising addition as well! But perhaps one of the most memorable and unusual dishes was the shrimp covered with cereal. When I saw this on the menu, I thought that the cereal was just the breading for the shrimp, but when the dish came, I saw that the dish had way more cereal than shrimp! Luckily, the crispy, sweet cereal was an absolutely delicious part of the meal, even eaten on its own!","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Mark B.,5,2018-02-13,"Three things my Buds from the Red Dot said I must try- Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, Bah Kuh Teh and Singapore Chili Crab. I crossed the first two at various hawker centers around town. For the Chili Crab many recommend me to come here. Arrived here via metro around 1300. Restaurant was at half capacity. The lunch rush crowd gone and no reservation needed. Yes!!!The food: Appetizer- shrimp with pumpkin purée. Really good! Shrimp Fried Rice- Another great dish. Enough for 2 people.Main- Singapore Chili Crab. Excellent!! Very flavorful. Spice level was just right. Enough kick to enjoy. Generous portion and good to the last bite.Environment/Service: Great! The waiter was very attentive. He also let me know I that I ordered enough for 2 people. Glad I stopped because I was about to order two more dishes. Love the bibs and large hand washing stations. You don't have that same luxury The meal was worth the price. Glad I listened to my buds that pointed me this way.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Tuan T.,5,2019-10-23,Went here during a business trip. Had to stop by twice to try two different type of crabs. Black pepper and chilly sauce crabs. We like the chilly one better,"['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Karen C.,5,2018-01-23,"A must-try when you're in Singapore. SO YUM. I'm drooling now as I write this review.I definitely recommend the chilli crab with lots of fried buns. We ordered that along with some veggies and fried rice. I would opt out of the fried rice and order extra buns instead. The chilli sauce is scrumptious. You would want to eat it all up. We got lucky and were able to walk in without a reservation. We sat outside while it was lightly drizzling, but we were not uncomfortable at all. The outdoor part of the restaurant had umbrellas to shield us from the rain, and the waiters provided covers to protect our belongings.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Phillip V.,4,2019-08-01,"Everything about this place was great aside from the price. Chilli Crab is expensive, I get it, but the quantity we got just wasn't the best for the price we paid. Other than that, though, now that that is out of the way, the food was freaking delicious and the reservation system online was really easy and convenient to use. The decor inside is very pleasant and comfortable and the servers were very helpful and polite, which made the atmosphere and experience good for us. Also the salted egg golden prawns were an excellent appetizer, along with the mantou bread to drench in our chilli crab sauce. Would still recommend coming to this place if you've never had chilli crab or are dying to get chilli crab, but I won't be back for a while after being underwhelmed by the quality:value ratio of Singapore's National Dish.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Em D.,3,2020-01-05,"Not worth the hype. Crab was good, but service was mediocre. Got in right away but we were there 10 mins before they opened. They forgot two of our entrees we ordered. Very nice servers, super crowded- clearly a local and tourist favorite. $$$$ dinner and we still left a bit hungry. Good location. Close to marina bay and other restaurants if the wait gets too long!","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Jeong P.,4,2017-07-28,"If chili crab is something you must try when visiting Singapore, then Jumbo Seafood is one of the best places to try it. Yes, it is a chain restaurant that is very pricey and very crowded, requiring a reservation if you want to avoid a long wait in the unrelenting heat. And if this is your first time trying chili crab, it will invariably fall short of your lofty expectations. But you should definitely still eat here when given the chance, because despite all this, the food is delicious.I personally favored the black pepper crab, which came smothered in a potent pepper sauce packed with a subtle kick, although the chili crab was delicious as well. Sopping up all of the sweet and spicy chili sauce with the fried buns was a most satisfying experience. The salted egg prawns were a pleasant surprise, with the egg yolk providing a mild flavor and interesting texture, while the sweet and crispy fried baby squid made for a perfect little appetizer. Despite being a bit of a novelty, there is no doubt that Jumbo Seafood prepares some quality seafood and a mean version of chili crab. If you're willing to deal with the steep prices (they charge for everything including the peanuts and wipes), the lackluster service and are lucky enough to score a reservation in the air conditioned section, you will be treated to a very tasty meal.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice

Jeanne T.,5,2017-10-20,"This place was recommended to my sister and I by someone to order the chili crab specifically. During my trip, chili crab was everywhere! I do wish I had tried it elsewhere to give a comparison however I'm not mad with only having eaten it here. My sister and I got one crab to share which was more than enough. It's truly the sauce that makes this dish so great. I love tomatoes, anything tomato based I'm typically a fan right off the bat and their sauce has a tomato-y base that is sweet and spicy and so addicting! I'd pour the sauce on anything and eat it that how good it is. We also ordered the ho fun, sadly I didn't take a picture of it but is really good! The gravy was very flavorful. My sister and I love the chili crab sauce so much that we even ended up mixing it with our noodles. Finger licking, bowl slurping good.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
April L.,1,2019-06-15,"1kg for s$88 for non swim crab, it is somewhat pricey and no service at all. They told the customers 2pm last call for ordering and the restaurant close at 3pm. A few tables came in around 1:30pm, they didn't come to us to play the order, when they finally do. The dishes took sometimes to come, then as you dig your hands into working on the crab, the waitress came asking for payment on the total.  All of us must clean our hands and get the money or card to pay first before continuing eating. This is for a pricy restaurant in the area and no customer service while they was not short hand at all, then they force you to drop everything to make payment. Unbelievable and unacceptable.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Meghan L.,4,2018-05-04,"I came here on a Saturday night without a reservation and didn't have to wait long. It's located by the river walk and patronized by a lot of out-of-town visitors.FOODChili Crab - Very good but extremely expensive. I think we paid $50USD for 1 crab which is ridiculous, but I can see why it's so popular. The sauce is a delicious blend of sweet and spicy and perfect with rice or man tou (buns) on the side.Man Tou - Yummy! They're slightly sweet and slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Definitely recommend! I just wish they were a little bigger because you can eat one in 2 bites.Noodles - I don't remember the name on the menu, but these noodles were super yummy. They were nice and sweet and spicy, and a decent amount for 2-3 people.Chinese Broccoli - This was just ok. I'm not a fan of Chinese broccoli in general and thought this dish was a bit weird with the thousand year eggs and egg yolk.SERVICEThe servers are super busy here and we had to flag ours down multiple times. They're very nice though, and the food comes out fairly quickly, considering the amount of people in the restaurant.OVERALLThe food was good, but overall very pricey (especially their famous chili crab). But would I come here again? Yes, because even though it's touristy, the food is still good.Oh, and that glass tray of yellow liquid on your table? It's just tea with lemon to wash your fingers with after eating crab. Don't drink it. You're welcome.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Mel D.,4,2017-08-04,"My friend took me here for Chili Crab because it's the must do thing in Singapore and this is a popular spot overlooking the water (Singapore River). The ambiance was amazing...the wait is super long so you definitely have time to grab a happy hour drink nearby. You put your name in the queue and they will call you when your table is ready. You can request your own table or a shared table which is probably quicker to get seated at. They quoted us 90 minutes but we were seated in less then 45. Now, on to the food. Though we tried the chili crab, my friend told me her favorite was the salt and pepper (which I wish we got instead). The chili crab is good but a bit too sweet for me (it's basically doused in sweet chili sauce - the kind you might dip your eggroll in). I prefer my crab on the savory side. We also got the fried rice - LOVED it. Morning Glory was to DIE FOR. And their special bread was a must to dip in the crab sauce!It seems almost impossible to have a bad meal in Singapore so this is another good one! I enjoyed myself and left with a food coma!","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Chris L.,4,2018-10-29,"The prawns with the pumpkin purée was hubby's fav thing to eat when we went to Singapore. This place is expensive but worth it to come once (there's plenty of other cheaper and better eats). The service was pretty attentive even though our chilli crab took forever. It doesn't come either the bread, which is pretty stingy considering the price of the crab (over $70 USD). I would come back with new people but not again on our own. This is a tourist trap and the prices reflect this.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice

So there is lots of people watching and fun stuff to see in the surrounding area. We ordered the chili crab and broccoli. The sauce on the chili crab was great! Also the crab was fresh and delicious. You can tell everything is made to order. The broccoli was too oily for me but it was cooked to the right tenderness. The service was fine..fast and efficient but not very friendly.

Theresa H.,4,2016-07-07,"First & foremost, I do not know where one yelper really went, this restaurant does not has a seating on a tarmac (what? We are not on the airport runway, lol!), indoor seating with really good AC, no visible bugs and plenty of soap & towels for the patrons. Back to my review:I love that the restaurant gives out bibs to the patrons. The bibs are so cute!!Had a reservation at noon today. We ordered chili crab, black pepper crab, deep fried prawns in cereal and a dozen of buns. Chili crab - definitely an A+. It was not too spicy and I really believe the chili crab here is better than those at No Signboard at Esplanade. Black pepper crab - that's a B. I have definitely had better black pepper crab elsewhere. Deep fried prawns in cereal - A. The small order has generous amount of prawns. At $24 and came without the shells, that was not bad at all. This dish was good but those at No Signboard at Esplanade is slightly better. Fried buns - A+ Despite someone commenting I have ""become fatter"" *eyes rolling* just last week, I have been indulging in fried food. The buns here were golden and crispy on the outside, and so soft in the inside. This definitely complements the Chili Crab. Definitely order these buns to go with the Chili Crab. Service was top notch and the staffs took peanuts and tree nuts allergies very seriously. So no chili crabs for those allergic to peanuts!! Will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try out Singapore's famous and very popular Chili Crab!!","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice

Derek C.,4,2019-02-28,This place is good if you are visiting the Clarke quay/boat quay area. I can't say it's the best chili crab because it's the first time having. The establishment was very busy and the whole area is busy at night. The chili crab had good taste and I recommend trying it if you are visiting.

Someone bring buns and put on their common table then my server comes and serve them to customers. So fucking ridiculous. Why not serve buns to me directly. So my bun was there in front of me and I had to wait for fucking 10min to get this cold bun.Besides customers nearby me ordered bun and they forgot and asked them again like in 15min.

Dave Y.,5,2017-11-12,"I highly recommend Jumbo. This particular location is excellent all around. ServiceWhile you might expect the service at a chain restaurant to be sub par, you'd be wrong about that at this particular Jumbo restaurant. The service was notably great. They were attentive, efficient, mindful of the number of guests in our party, and quick to keep us updated on the status of our cooking crabs. One manager even went out of his way to convince us NOT to order so much. He saved us $100 and a night of misery. That was very hospitable and ethical of him. FoodOMG. If crab was meant to be served and eaten by gods, then there ought to be no other way to serve or eat crab than this. The perfect balance of sweet, tangy, salty, and spicy. I don't know how else to describe the succulent taste that enraptures your taste buds. We ordered both the Chili Crab and the Blk Pepper Crab. Both excellent. But above I am speaking of the Chili crab. EnvironmentExcellent location. The restaurant is always jamming. But they do a good and efficient job of spacing everyone apart. I HIGHLY recommend you making reservations. If you are in Singapore, you will/must try this joint.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice

Night one after arrival, we found ourselves here. There were 6 of us, and I thought my (male) coworkers were joking when they said we were going to order 4 crabs. At about $60/crab...say what?!?1 But wanting to have the full experience, I acquiesced. The final menu for our table:- 4 crabs (2 chili, 2 black pepper)- an order of the tiger prawns- fresh steamed abalone- fried rice- bok choy (because you need your greens)The crabs were good, but to be honest, I enjoyed the black pepper crab better than the chili crab, which was marinated in so much tomato sauce that it was actually quite difficult to eat.  The tiger prawns though....this was worth it. It was about $15/skewer (of ONE prawn) but it was one of the best prawns I have ever had. The abalone was silky smooth. The fried rice and bok choy were as good as fried rice and bok choy can be, but nothing out of this world.The total bill was a whopping $700SGD...ouch! But when in Rome, right? I am glad we tried it, but at these prices, I am not so sure it was worth it. I wish I had a point of comparison, and should have tried it at other places, but that will have to wait for the next trip.  I would definitely recommend a go at the Abalone and for sure the prawns. This is what upped it from a 3 to 4 star in my books.p.s. I truly do appreciate they have a hand-washing station. A definitely must! =)","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Agnes N.,4,2019-02-15,"Jumbo is a 'must go stop' for me whenever I am back in Singapore for vacation. Jumbo has numerous outlets across Singapore and this review is for The Riverwalk outlet. Their baby squid appetizer is a must have.They are crunchy with the right amount of sweetness. I had the herbal live Prawns, cereal prawns, mocha ribs and many other dishes. All were delicious. Service was great too as staff were very attentive. However, my dining experience was spoiled by a company having their staff dinner celebration. They were obnoxious with their loud 'yum shengs' throughout the duration I was there. While I understand it is Chinese New Year, I feel that party should have spared a thought for other diners in the restaurant. Maybe Jumbo can advise big parties to be mindful with their noise level next time as this restaurant is rather small and any noise is amplified in this enclosed airconditioned area. I talked to a service staff abt the noise disturbance and the management served my party with a complimentary dessert. A nice gesture by the management of Jumbo. While I appreciate the nice gesture, I would have preferred to enjoy my dinner without the noise disturbance. I recommend this seafood restaurant and hopefully next time, I will not be dining with large noisy groups.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Nat W.,4,2017-08-11,I had a reservation but I arrive to the restaurant one hour early and they were able to seat us outside right away. They ran out of small crabs so my mom and I ordered medium to share. The size of the crab was just right. It gets really messy and I saw some local people bringing in their own plastic gloves and wipes. How smart and professional :)You have to order the fried bread to dip in the chili sauce. It is so heavenly! I didn't find the price is particularly expensive for the crab itself but I thought the side dishes and drinks are quite high. Stir fried spinach for 15 dollars....umm I don't think so. The customer service is just okay...nothing special. I wish they kept the bathroom clean because even the basin was really disgusting.,"['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Jay L.,3,2017-12-07,"During our visit we swung by and tried the crabs like tourists do. The service when in the restaurant was on par with a busy chinese restaurant. What tainted our experience was the hostess at the other Jumbo location on Merchant road (not sure where this review most appropriately fits). Being tourists, our cab dropped us off at the Merchant road location, right in time for our reservation at the Riverwalk. Once they let us know we were in the wrong spot, we asked if they would let the other location know we were on our way. The hostess said she would not. Having a toddler in tow did not elicit any sympathy from the hostess, and she reminded us we had 10 minutes left to make our reservation before it was given away. Eventually, the food was good. I have never had chili crab, and thought it was okay. The fried buns are a bit greasy, I would stick with the regular ones. The food is pricey as expected. I thought it was a good one-time food experience. I do not feel the need to go back and visit again.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
Jenique M.,1,2020-01-18,"Unfortunately my rating isnt about the food. I never got a chance to try anything. I have never felt so unwanted and disrespected in my life. I took a solo trip to singapore and was really looking forward to trying food from Jumbo. Especially after watching so many videos about it. Needless to say i should have payed attention to the fact only asians were on the videos. I had a 7pm reservation. Not even 2 minutes after being seated i was being rushed to order. I politely asked the waitress for a few minutes to look over the menu. 10 minutes later a new waitress comes and ask for my order. As i am trying to order my food she kept saying ""thats too much for you"" to everything. I asked aee you speaking of the portions or the price. I was well aware of what i would be spending. I am not a budget traveler. She did not answer and walked off. I payed for my tea with another waitress and walked out.","['Hainan', 'Chicken Shop']",Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice
