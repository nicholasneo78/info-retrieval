Will come more often."
Fu Lin Men (NSRCC),"Chinese, Seafood",melwqy,5,"My husband and I were looking to hold a small, intimate solemnisation together with lunch for 10 pax. Fulinmen NSRCC was the only restaurant that offered us a private room for this, with no extra venue charges or minimum spending. We also loved the scenic environment of the restaurant, overlooking the spacious golf course. 
Right from our first recce visit, Ruel has been easy-going and extremely helpful. He is very responsive over text to any questions I have, and goes out of his way to fulfill some of my requests (e.g. having access to the room from 10am onwards for preparations). On the evening before my solemnisation lunch, he even took the liberty to send photographs of the room setup, to assure me that everything is ready and in place (as attached). 
On the day of the solemnisation, Ruel was in the private room at all times, together with a helper. Once we arrived, he served us coffee and tea, and was on standby to offer help whenever he can. Once he saw that the solemnisation was wrapping up, he also took the initiative to start getting the dishes ready for service. The entire event flow was seamless due to his attention to detail. Of course, the lunch proceeded smoothly. Each dish in the 6-course meal was individually plated, and every dish was delicious! We especially enjoyed the lotus leaf rice, which was packed with so many ingredients and super satisfying! For the dessert, the portions of peach resin was super generous too. Ruel also took the effort to check whether each of us wanted the dessert warm or chilled.
Overall, it was a super pleasant experience with Ruel and his team. My husband and I are super glad we chose to celebrate our special day at Fulinmen NSRCC, and our family has nothing but praises for the food and service as well! Highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion, especially for brides-to-be looking for a fuss-free experience for your banquet/solemnisation!More"

Bar-Roque Grill,"French, Steakhouse",MeilianyWu,5,"My good friend and I had dinner at Bar-Roque last night. It was our first time to dine there.

The food were great as well as the service.
The lady, Jess, who took care of us throughout the dinner was great and proactive. We felt like she has her antenna up although she is invisible to us. I felt like I was at a luxury 5-star restaurant. 

When my friend ordered the dover sole fish and expressed concern on bones, the waitress assured her that there wouldn‚Äôt be an issue when we need to remove the bone. There won‚Äôt be soft bones. But, a while later Jess approached my friend and offered to have the bones of the fish to be removed by the chef when it is being processed for cooking. Of course my friend accepted the suggestion gladly. 

I chose the wagyu steak from their special dishes. Since I cannot take medium done steak, I always choose well done type although people always said well done beef steak is hard and is not nice. But, what I had yesterday was tender, tasty, and great. 

Then, throughout the dinner Jess also observed when our drinking water was running low, she would come to refill our glasses. 
She would also check in with us about the food.
When we ordered for raspberry sorbet, she confirmed, ‚ÄúOne scoop of raspberry sorbet for you only?‚Äù
I replied, ‚ÄúWe will share.‚Äù
Then we received two spoons. 
It was the first time I had a service person to ask and clarify about dessert when there are more than one person dining. 

It was such enjoyable dining experience at Bar-Roque. It is so heartening to see that the restaurant was still busy and applies two seatings during the pandemic. I wish them all the best."

The desert were just perfect at the end to finish on a sweet note. 

Quantity wise, it was more than enough surprisingly ! 

One more detail: we also get another desert for the Birthday celebration and it was very nice.

Regarding the staff, I just want to say: Thank you, the service was excellent, we had the description of each dish and wine, checking whether everything was fine. So in terms of service, I have nothing to say except very nice !

Paulaner Brauhaus Singapore,"German, Bar",worldlyhermit,4,"First off: I‚Äôm originally from Germany, so I‚Äôm a picky eater by birth and have been exposed to a lot of German food over the years. My expectations when someone promises me ‚Äúauthentic German cuisine‚Äù are therefore both: high and slightly peppered with suspicion. The latter is due to the tendency of ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù restaurants abroad to only cater to the stereotypical German dishes. German food is not only Bratwurst and Sauerkraut. Every region has their own specialties and while it is certainly impossible to cover them all on a menu, I appreciate it, if you can find at least a bit of variety. 
Paulaner delivers on that front in that it specializes in Bavarian cuisine but includes some meals from other regions as well (e.g. the Zwiebelrostbraten which is a Swabian speciality). I tried the latter and while it is quite solid and will probably give you a rough idea about the dish, it does not quite compare to the local interpretations back in Germany. 
It‚Äôs like watching pictures of that beautiful sunset you captured on your last holiday. The nostalgia is triggered and it‚Äôs still quite enjoyable but it does not beat the experience then and there. Then again, if you‚Äôve never had the original experience you won‚Äôt regret it either. 
It‚Äôs similar with the beer: while there is better beer in Germany, Paulaner beer still beats almost every other international beer. If you haven‚Äôt had any other good German beer, you will get a solid idea of the general taste of German brews. 
In summary: if you don‚Äôt have a reference (and hence accompanying expectations) for traditional German food, you will get one here and hopefully choose to visit Germany and explore its culinary landscape some more. Otherwise expect some solid German dishes away from home but don‚Äôt get your hopes up for that ‚ÄúSchweinshaxe von Oma‚Äù (pork knuckles made by grandma) experience.

The service was impeccable and our waitress, Annabel, was quite knowledgeable in all things German as she is (half?-) German herself. Make sure to ask her about recommendations if you‚Äôre unsure about your meal or beer choice (or plan to visit Germany)."
Paulaner Brauhaus Singapore,"German, Bar",harryt2017,4,"Visited with a friend in December 2020. Ordered Kasespatzle, Schweinshaxe, and Pork Schnitzel. The food quality was wonderful, with brilliantly warm and creamy cheesy goodness in the Kasespatzle, which was not jelak unlike some other places, and neither was it overly salty, which can be a problem as well. The pairing of fried onions elevated the dish by adding a crispy savoury-sweetness that goes very well to up the level of creamy cheesy sauce and the springy egg noodles. The Schweinshaxe was paired with a rich and very savoury dark beer sauce which added a nice punch to the dish, and elevated the taste of the pork knuckle. Loved the sauerkraut pairing as it was well balanced, not too sweet, not too sour, and not too salty, and not too mushy. However, the other item that was in the Schweinshaxe dish as a second side vaguely reminded me of a potato dough dumpling. That was slightly bland and a bit too doughy for my liking. The schnitzel was quite good, not greasy, and the flour batter thin enough, and meat tender and not dry. However, the pairing of fries felt a bit lacking and weighed a little too much on an already-heavy fried dish like schnitzel. Perhaps swapping for mashed potatoes or potato salad and an acidic option like a slaw or sauerkraut would make for a better option to balance out the heaviness of the dish. The Weisbier here is sublime, crisp, fruity, and refreshing, tasting like liquid gold in my opinion. However, many of the staff were quite inattentive and rather cold, even if they were efficient. Luckily there was a lady who was very nice and was very willing to help us take photos and proactively brought out extra cutlery when my friend had dropped his on the floor. Made the good food even better and compensated for the lack of friendliness on the part of her other colleagues."

Golden Peony at Conrad Centennial Singapore,"Chinese, Asian",starzdevil,2,"Came here a few months ago for Restaurant Week and it was a let down down by a service staff at the end of the brunch.
I was replied in the previous review that that was a one-time incident. But guess what? 
Today was a let down again by the same said service staff (and another) from the very start. 

I remembered the dim sum being good, and without looking at the menu (which was only CNY menu - my bad) booked a table to bring my mum along this time. We were early, and reached at about 11.10am outside the restaurant for the reservation at 11.30am. The staff were doing roll call and briefing, no problem. We just hung around and waited till 11.30am and as there was another lady who went ahead first, the first staff (in orange cheongsam) at the hostess area led her and her friend in. While we stood there and waited. The same lady in suit who spoilt our last experience stood up from behind the wall and just brusquely asked ‚ÄòDo you have a reservation‚Äô - no hi, no smile, nothing. I am not expecting a formal greeting or anything, but I think a simple hi is just courtesy? 

I told her yes, gave my name, and she just went ahead to stare at the list of reservations with an unsmiling face. I had to repeat my name again for her to locate me. And after, she led us in by just telling me in Chinese ‚Äòthis way‚Äô. She didn‚Äôt even acknowledge my guests. 

Sat us down and another lady in suit (slightly plump) without letting us sit down just asked us what tea and rattled off a list of teas when we asked what teas there are - all while we were all standing around the table. 

She came by again to take our orders. And it was just that. Transactional. 

The food on the menu today was less than decent. Yes, fresh ingredients, but repetitive, especially when we ordered 1 of everything on the CNY menu. The only person who made a slight difference was Esther, who served and chatted to us causally, no airs. And she was so attentive that when from afar she spotted that our desserts were not on the table yet, u-turned and went back into what I assumed was the kitchen to follow up. There was an Indian gentleman serving us quietly too, polite, but just quiet. 

Perhaps my expectations were too high, but coming from a reputable restaurant in a reputable hotel, twice on different occasions with bad service is enough. I ain‚Äôt expecting too much. I just need to be greeted, even casually is fine. Or even more basically, to be acknowledged as a guest, not a customer. 

This is the last time I am coming here, and never recommending this place to anyone."

I would like to give a big shout out to the entire Golden Peony team for making this entire event possible. Special thanks to Stanley and Vanessa - who are always on the ball with our requests and email queries from the beginning of the preparation to the actual day itself. 

They made the effort to meet up with us on multiple occasions to discuss plans amidst the ever-changing situation due to covid restrictions to being proactive - taking their own initiative on the actual day itself by helping us to request for a room with the hotel for us to change our gowns more comfortably.

As for the food, our guests were all very pleased with the taste and the presentation. Especially the dim sum, avocado dessert, and filo pastry to name a few.

Overall the entire experience from start to finish was very pleasant. Definitely will recommend it to those who wish to have their wedding in a nice and cozy ambience with good food.

Keep up the good work, Golden Peony team!More"

Alma By Juan Amador,"European, Fusion",WPH72,2,"Went to Alma last weekend for their 5-course dinner at $198++.  Made the reservation for Dec initially, then was told before our Dec date that the menu has been revised to over $300 for the festive menu and we could wait till after Jan 5 where it would be back to $178+.  We waited and did as asked, and was even asked to pick our food options which I did (Hungarian goose).  

One day before our dinner on Friday, I get an email that says the menu has been updated and it is now $198++ with duck instead being offered.  I decided against my better judgement not to cancel as this reservation had involved many calls from them and emails, and they also apologised with a free bottle of Bordeaux red (their house pour at $78 per bottle, retails around $25 in supermarkets so their cost is closer to $15).

We arrived soaked because the restaurant's parking is outdoors and they did not have a shelter to receive guests at the front entrance which had 5-6 steps of stairs that were uncovered.  In the heavy downpour, we had no chance.   The hostess did not have any staff offering to shelter guests coming out of their cars in the wet.

I had indicated that we do not eat foie gras and prefer not to eat sea urchin in my initial reservation.  The 3 snacks offered, 1 had foie gras and the first course was sea urchin !  So far not so good.  First course also came with a sorbet (not as a palette cleanser after but as part of the food), then second course came with an ice cream.  Innovative but surely not back to back ?

Main course sadly we both chose duck, and it was an unqualified disaster.  The duck breast was undercooked, very pink and the fat unrendered.  It was tiny sliver of duck, about 4 includes long and tapered from the thickest part at about 7mm to the thinnest part which was about 3-4mm.  I am not kidding, it was such a thin sliver we didn't think they were serious.  My partner took half a bite and left the rest, and the only thing they offered was to put it back in the oven which we declined because it was very fat anyway.

Saving grace was the ode to the local culture with the tribute to Yan Kun toast (they put a foie gras toast in Chinese style paper bag) and the dessert which was light and delightful, a thin wafer coated with chocolate served on top of a white chocolate ice cream.

Overall, the worst Michelin experience we have had, and we have clocked 13 Michelin stars in the last 4 months so we have had a lot to compare with."
Alma By Juan Amador,"European, Fusion",Joseph C,5,"My heavenly experience in Alma began with the 100% Sangiovese red wine from San Felice Campogiovanni Brunello di Montalcino Riserva II Quercione ‚Äì surely when I sipped the top 1% of all wines in the world, I knew I just had to savour the taste and let it linger, and forget about finding the words to describe the taste of this exquisite vintage. Next came Alma‚Äôs signature potato bread that oozed with aroma with its warm texture that is perfect for the spread of Bordier Smoke Butter, leaving me to crave for more, and yes, I did end up eating all three pieces served in the beautiful wooden box laden with coffee beans. My first course of today‚Äôs lunch was the popular Crispy Tofu ‚Äì when my teeth sank into the tofu with the blend of wild mushroom, truffle and foie gras, it was ecstatic ‚Äì the mix between hard and soft for the palate is like consuming sweet music to the ears. When the second course Boston Losbter was served, it was so picturesque I halted to admire the dish ‚Äì the Angel Hair pasta and broccoli formed the mountainous terrain with the top flattened by the lobster boulders while the Hijiki Seaweed projected the source of multiple waterfalls cascading down the mountains. The finale of the 3-course lunch ended with ‚ÄúPoire Belle Helene‚Äù with Alma‚Äôs new dessert ‚Äì with the unique pouring of passion fruit juice with (jin xuan) tea onto the vanilla poached pears, served with 72% chocolate, whipped cream and roasted almonds. I was mesmerized by the balance of flavours (the bitterness in the chocolate that contrasted with the sweetness of the pear and cream) and balance of textures (the soft juice with tea contrasted the crunch of almonds and the firm pear). If you want to experience how food could be served to titilate your palate and senses, go to Alma."
Alma By Juan Amador,"European, Fusion",Globa1Foodie,5,"After trying out nearly all the fine dining places in SG, I would say Alma is by far the best restaurant in town, and excellent value for money. I just wish they had more vegetarian options to choose from so that we can visit more often. Currently the vegetarian options are a bit limited, especially with only one option for the main course for lunch."
Alma By Juan Amador,"European, Fusion",22jws,4,Delicious food with consistent quality of food and service. The lobster angel hair pasta is always good so we have been returning every month! Their potato bread is also exceptionally good.
Alma By Juan Amador,"European, Fusion",t1morthy,5,"You have to trust a Michelin-Starred restaurant for this. Their freshly made signature potato bread from Alma by Juan Amador is outrageously good. Served as starter before the main course, the bread is served in a covered wooden box  accompanied with coffee beans.

A bite promises to deliver a crisp on its surface while exuding an aromatic flavor and moist in the center. I‚Äôd say you will not require any additional spread of butter to enhance it. That‚Äôs how good the bread is. Of course you can be assured for the rest of the meal, it‚Äôs gonna blow your mind away.

You can be sure to spoil for choices when it comes to the appetizers, main and desserts. Each serving is skillfully embellished that makes it so appetizing right before us.

Above all, their service is first class - warm service, and it‚Äôs staff are very attentive to detail. Fantastic hospitality! Definitely will come back for more!More"

Cherry Garden,"Chinese, Asian",NikittaFinitta,5,"Being a relatively young couple, the idea of heading into a traditional Chinese restaurant without the company of senior family members has always been rather intimidating. However, Uncle Sam (the manager of the restaurant) along with each of his team members made it such a warm and memorable experience, that we returned two nights in a row for dinner! They took time in explaining the dishes as well as letting us if we ordered too much - Sam even went the extra mile to customise a mini portion of fried rice for us, as he felt the regular small portion would be way too much for our table of 2.

The quality of food served is as impeccable as the service given by the entire team, and we left both nights with our bellies and heart full.

I would 100% recommend you try the Peking Duck as well as the stir-fried wheat noodles (mian xian). It was incredible."

- spicy beef linguine

the mushroom soup was umami and delicious.

the spicy beef linguine had an interesting fusional Asian taste, and wasn't actually spicy (to me), so non-spicy eaters might be able to enjoy it. the portion was large and definitely filling.

the banana cheesecake was texturally interesting---soft yet firm. the banana taste came through quite well, with a hint of cheesecakiness.

The Wine & Gourmet Friends,"Bar, Wine Bar",jill_dies,5,"A one minute walk from Outram Park MRT (Exit H onto New Bridge Road), The Wine and Gourmet Friends is a quaint restaurant tucked away beside Dorsett Singapore. However, don't be fooled by its small size, as within the restaurant it extends out into a chic and classy restaurant with a bar and a wine cellar.  My sister and I came here with the recommendation of trying their Crab and Uni Risotto and their Iberico ""Bah Kut Teh"" Risotto, I opted for the latter as it came with a 3-course lunch set for $30 with Truffle Cambert and Along Ice Cream (there are other options in the courses).  As an avid lover of Bah Kut Teh, my initial reaction to removing the soup from a Teo Chew classic seemed almost criminal, but expectations were blown away once I actually tried the dish. The juicy, roasted, fall of the bone pork ribs is a fantastic twist to the classic dish and topped with a creamy risotto base really seals the dish together. What was a mother pleasant surprise came in the form of the Truffle Cambert, the mild Cambert cheese was sandwiched between a fragrant truffle spead and topped with walnuts and rasins to add a depth of flavour. My sister absolutely loved this dish and ate most of my starter course. 

In terms of ambiance, upon entering the restaurant the first thing that catches my eye is a magnificent display of wine bottles rating their top 10 products. Unfortunately, it was only 12PM in the afternoon so it seemed a little unrefined to be getting a headstart in drinking, so I opted for a more mild sweet wine to accompany my lunch. My sister and I went to take a garner at their grand wine collection which was an experience in itself, I imagine if I was more of a wine connoisseur at heart I could enjoy the experience a little more but for now, I could only be blown away by their wide selection of options. 

I definitely recommend coming here during lunch hours on a weekday where their lunch set is available to try their course meals for a more value for money experience and come in the evening for a more fine-dining experience."
The Wine & Gourmet Friends,"Bar, Wine Bar",chwjoelle,5,"I visited this restaurant with my sister for a chill weekday lunch. It was peaceful and the staff were friendly. They also have a wide selection of wines for sale. 

She ordered the set lunch, which was a good deal, while I had the Crab and Uni Risotto. I took bites out of some of her food (with her consent!) and I would recommend the  Truffle Camembert, if you are a fan of truffle! The oolong ice cream served as her dessert was delicious as well. 

My Crab and Uni Risotto was savoury and creamy. The uni was fresh and slightly sweet, while the trout roe gave an interesting texture in each bite. I recommend trying this if you are a fan of uni and caviar. The portion was also just right.

My sister had the Bak Kut Teh risotto, which was an interesting take on the traditional dish. It would be a comforting meal on a rainy day! Captured in one of the photos are the bones of the pork ribs cleaned off by my sister  üëçMore"

Rise Restaurant,"International, Healthy",TheBear128,3,"I thought of having my birthday celebration at RISE seeing all the positive recent reviews and considering that i am having a staycation at the place.  We had the pre CNY menu and it turns out that most of the food is nothing to shout about, and we did order single portions for most of the food ~ 
Halibut over cooked, meat was dry, i would consider waste of good ingredient.
Roast meat hardly impressed me as I had better in my own neighbourhood.
Pumpkin Ravioli ~ pasta was dry, even the pumpkin filling was dry
Selection and quality of cakes and sweets ~ disappointing, i had better from the local 'Four leaves' bakery and Bengawan Solo
The good dishes that i had ~ seafood platter, impressionable plating with dry ice, decent quality seafood. Sashimi Bento ~ Tuna and salmon tastes fresh and meaty.
Sure, the ambient is good so i guess if you dont mind average food, sure, drop by. Otherwise, there's better food at lower costs in the local scene or if you want better food, elsewhere you'd probably get more bang for your buck ~ its 87 nett per pax for this mealMore"

Rise Restaurant,"International, Healthy",Samansara,5,"I recently had a private celebration with family and friends at RISE restaurant. To say that i was impressed was an understatement. It was far beyond my expectations and the cherry on the icing was the service. Having a Hospitality background myself, It seems service levels in many places in Singapore has lapsed seriously over the years. But RISE brings back the old days of true hospitality. 

The entire celebration was made possible by our sales manager Ms. Tan Wy-Lin who was nothing but the epitome of class and professionalism since the beginning. The actual day itself was an experience which blew the minds of all our guests by Mr. Edwick and his team who were at our beck and call and delivered such impeccable service.

A huge gratitude to the chef who made sure each and every single dish was just absolutely scrumptious and the food kept coming in. My guests definitely left with their bellies and hearts filled with awe and happiness. 

And we cannot be happy enough and we are so so grateful that we made the decision to select RISE as the venue for our special day because it was definitely a really memorable and a truly unforgettable experience. 

Sincerely,
Mr&Mrs. Singh

Greenleaf Cafe,"Indian, Asian",kracycm,5,"My husband and I had the best vegetarian Indian lunch here today. All the dishes we ordered were stellar! The banana flower cake was divine ; we can taste the fresh herbs and good quality ingredients that went into this lovingly deep fried dish. Best part? They weren‚Äôt even the slightest bit oily. My chapatti was fluffy and light. The poori were so delicious and doesn‚Äôt taste of stale oil. The mushroom peppery stir fry was surprisingly delicious and bursting w flavour; I can taste the ginger bay leaves and basil that went into this beautiful dish. And we use our breads to mop up every single morsel in our tomato based paneer. We both agreed the cheese is so fresh, and the best tasting we have ever tried. Our milk ginger tea came w brown sugar; they are so fragrant. The sweet lassi also deserves special mention; it‚Äôs light , slightly sweet and so fresh. All in all, a most sumptuous yet healthy meal. The friendly owner and his lovely wife are so pleasant. We will be back for more!!More"
Greenleaf Cafe,"Indian, Asian",Keith D,5,"Found this restaurant on TripAdvisor and was not disappointed.  Husband and wife team . Good local vibe. Great food . Poori bread delicious. Mushroom marsala tiptop along with a sweet n sour cauliflower dish.  Added a couple of roti to mop up the curry.  Dessert very nice almond,  some kind of sugar and  rose water combo .. very friendly,  great food  marsala tea cant wait to return or order out."
Greenleaf Cafe,"Indian, Asian",BackbenchersInt,5,"Greenleaf, once again won my heart for serving the one and only Herbal cuisine in Singapore. They are South Indians dishes and very creative in fusing dishes. We had Panner and blackpepper long grain rice. 
Awesome and authentic Rava thosai, unlike the commercial type. Homemade ginger tea. 
When comes to traditional food, presentation doesn't matter."
Greenleaf Cafe,"Indian, Asian",SingaporeSwoon,5,"Another one visited on the basis of reviews here. Quiet when I went on monday lunchtime. The man who I assume is the boss was very helpful providing some guidance on what to have, settled for a south indian thali with chappati. It arrived pretty quickly. By default they also serve cumin flavoured warm warter as an accompaniment. Never had that before but very nice.

Food was great, about 10 different little pots, all of which but the sweet one was empty pretty quickly. Definitely deserves its high rating for the food,  the service and the attitude. Menu is interesting as it opens with a 'declaration' what it does/doesnt use in its food and why. They are clearly deeply food focused.

only thing to fault?? mmm, the boss is a Liverpool fan :-), but apart from that, he is a really nice chap."

Greenleaf Cafe,"Indian, Asian",Snickerjack,1,"We read the rave reviews, hoped to try authentic South Indian food. Opted to get a taxi from the other side of the city to try the Thali, believing this would encompass a variety of flavours. On arriving my partner smiled at the staff awaiting a table. Despite it being empty, we stood waiting until someone eventually came along and presented as uninterested- perhaps that should have been our warning. After requesting the Thali, we watched as the items were taken from the left over buffet - unknown how long it had sat out for however the rice etc all arrived cold / poppadoms were soggy  and we noticed items were missing from what was advertised on the menu. We sat trying to get someone‚Äôs attention, however staff were uninterested/ on phones etc. Eventually I had to get up and enquire to be told they didn‚Äôt have the items left that was on the menu. The staff then added one other left over item from the buffet- again soggy and cold/ stale. The items on the thali were lacking in flavour, cold and we were really disappointed. When it came to pay, again we had to get up and go and ask someone. Overall, no idea why this has the reviews it does as it‚Äôs the worst service / Indian food we have ever encountered."

Leo Cafe & Restaurant,"Cafe, Asian",Pam H,5,"Located snugly on the 2nd level of Populous Hotel, is LEO'S CAFE. I'm drawn to them not only for their addictive food but also to the staff's warm, genuine and excellent hospitality. Each time I visit Leo's Cafe, I forget that I'm a customer. üòãü§≠ Back to food, I've tried their saut√©ed salad, shown in the picture below. It consists of Shitake Mushrooms and Baby Potatoes, adorned with bell peppers to add that extra color and spice. Everything was done to perfection  like fresh from a grill-out, except that it wasn't. ü§™Staff was extremely helpful in tweaking the taste to my liking. (Im pretty sensitive to saltiness). Kudos to Siew Lee for thisü§ó

Next, their pizza, a newly-invented recipe, is to die for. Highly Recommended for their thin crust & deliciously melted cheese. I had a video taken but unfortunately, can't seem to upload it. The Pictures below include their Mushroom pizza and Hawaiian pizza! My all-time fav? Definitely The MushroomüçÑüçï!!!

I also tried their Nasi Ayam Pecah, an invention by the Owner's Daughter who's talent in adding the traditional touch of Indonesian tang to her dishes makes me wanting more. (I love spice!üòç)
The Ayam had a slightly crisped exterior (skin) and tenderised flesh that was served with a generous dollop of the spiced sauce which made the entire dish lip-smacking flavourful. The vegetables by the side were fresh but slightly bland for a reason  It's to complement the rich flavour of the chicken by mixing it in and it balances everything out to perfection again!

There are also a variety of liquor/mocktails/draught beers (even beer towers! ü§§) available.. giving it a very bar-like feel. 

Totally great for a chill-out session with friends/family and even by yourself üòå There's a sliding door that allows you to relax/dine while enjoying the external ambience.

Overall, Leo's Cafe offers reasonable prices, given the superior quality of their Food and Service.. It's definitely the place to be! ü§©üçªMore"

Cure,"Irish, European",Monsterinc,3,"We found the taste, presentation and curation of dishes nothing special. In fact, the food was not very tasty (the frothy broth for the potato slices was very very salty and neither of us could finish it), some ingredients didn‚Äôt contribute to the taste, the presentation was quite tired. The ambience was not good - music was ‚ÄúGuns and roses‚Äù and such like loud music all night and random people would walk in and have a drink at the bar barely an arm‚Äôs length from our table. It just didn‚Äôt give the vibe of an expensive restaurant - which Cure is. To make it worse, the $200 deposit we had to place to book a table was not automatically deducted from the $466 bill and will only be refunded 7 days later. In my view, Cloudstreet is so much better for a similar price point."
Cure,"Irish, European",ZeeY_11,5,"Food was really amazing and every single dish was like unveiling art! Exquisite ingredients and really unique taste that you won't get elsewhere.

Cure,"Irish, European",Globa1Foodie,3,We came here with high expectations but were a bit disappoited with their vegetarian meu. The food was good but not great. The dishes were too heavy on the sour / pickled / tart taste. The cheese platter was boring.
Cure,"Irish, European",2702lo,4,Always a great place to done. Really worth the visit. But it s disappointing to see them charge you for extra items you didn't request (such as an extra bottle of water). It s cheap and they shouldn t spoil the experience by tricking you in spending 10 dollars more. But overall the food is lovely. Just be careful with the bill.

Cure,"Irish, European",sgaufusion,4,"Great to have an Irish inspired menu and the dishes were innovative, varied, attractive and flavourful. The soda bread with Guinness, the duck and the oyster were highlights, but every dish had its merits. Although the staff were attentive, there was little engagement other than reciting the content of the dishes - no Irish (or Singapore) charm to accompany the food. We were disappointed with the size of the wine pour. When there is no marking on the glass a direct pour seems a hit or miss approach and we felt under-served in two of our three glasses."
Cure,"Irish, European",Tottochan09,4,"Enjoyed my lunch at CURE with a friend. The dishes are all made with so much sincerity, some might be bite sized, but you can taste the layers of taste. Impressed by the chef. Efforts were made in display of food too! Would highly recommend and don‚Äôt mind returning! 

It is a bit dark inside the restaurant though. Maybe we are supposed to just enjoy the food and not to take photos! 

The waiter and waitress tried their best to introduce each dish, but with the mask worn, sometimes we couldn‚Äôt make out what they trying to say. A pity."

For appetiser we had fried soft shell crab and also cold tofu with century egg & meat floss. What a beautiful blend of flavours ! It was refreshing too . 

For main dishes , 
- we had stir fried kailan with garlic. The stems were so crunchy! 
- We had 2 flavours of soup - chicken soup in coconut, spicy & sour soup . I really love the chicken soup. And to top it off, the coconut flesh was so smooth & soft when I scooped it out. Yummy ! The spicy & sour soup reminded me of Szechuan soup. But it was different. Was a little too spicy for me but tasty nonetheless. 
- We also ordered a 3 -meat dish consisting of sweet char Siew, roast pork belly and roast chicken. The pork belly was my favourite with crispy skin . 
- steamed fish was so fresh, soft & tasty !
- fried ee fu noodles , absolutely delicious! 

Since it we were celebrating a birthday, they offered complimentary steamed green bean buns plated on a pretty platter with a candle . It was a lovely surprise for mom. 

The other server whom i would like to commend was Chin Chin. She was professional, responsive , courteous and helped to make our meal a lot more enjoyable.  She was quick to change our plates, quick to clear the table of dishes that were eaten . 

It was overall a really enjoyable dinner with great food and wonderful staff.

We were impressed with the decoration and most of the time we were busy taking pictures and selfies. This place is cozy but it gets crowded and noisy when crowd starts coming in during lunch. The service is ok and the food is nice, the portion is generous. This is a nice place but not suitable for me as it gets noisy and crowded during lunch. I can hardly hear my partner talking to me.."
My Awesome Cafe,"French, Bar",517isah,5,"Found this boutique cafe on Google Maps for our social gathering of 7 during phase 3 of COVID restrictions. The deco and feel make it very nostalgic (haha - revealing my age a bit). We sat at a high table with high chairs for breakfast .The menu looked interesting, but would require some time to navigate. Thankfully the front page of the breakfast menu with the four step process made this easier. They were not stingy on the meat. Eggs came only in two options of scrambled or hard boiled. We enjoyed the oats with coconut and berries. Service was prompt and without issues. Payment methods are currently limited to cash and PayNow."

My Awesome Cafe,"French, Bar",Syzh6666,1,"If you want to come there , please think twice before your going.
My experience is:
The food was good, but the service was TERRIBLE:
1. Have made a call to ask for a reservation in advance. However, the staff told me that ""we do not accept the reservation and you can walk-in"" When I come, another staff asked me,"" do you have a reservation?""

- Huh? are you sure the two staff are from the SAME restaurant?

2. Please inform your customer they only can have a 2-hour meal in advance INSTEAD OF giving them last minute acknowledgment to let them pay the bill and get out even if they haven't finished the food‚Äîyou guys quite good at clearing the table immediately WITHOUT PERMISSION.

Even though lots of customers well recognize your restaurant and you may not care about my review.

But I still want to say:

Please train your staff well and let them know the restaurant is more than just becoming a making money machine. The food you delivered, the culture, and the value you give to the customer is more important.

Please treat your customer with the right attitude and professionalism. To be honest, clearing the table without permission is very offensive and impolite.
PLEASE TREAT YOUR CUSTOMER AS WELL AS YOUR FOOD PROPERLY."

Its one of those places that you go to for lunch and 5hrs later you're still there.
I've been here for lunch and dinner and on occasions without a reservation.   That's always a bit tricky because there's normally a queue of people waiting to get in.  That said, if they can accommodate they will.

Let's not forget the food   yum.  Make sure you bring a big appetite as the portions are good.  They also have a great wine selection (sometimes its a little too great hence our extended stays).  

Looking forward to my next visit."

Elixir Boutique Roasters,Cafe,hongquan448,5,"2 weeks ago, I visited Elixir Boutique Roasters and their breakfast platter is just amazing. The scrambled eggs are textbook level, soft and just a little runny. The brioche tastes slightly sweet, and is toasted to that optimal spot where it's crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. The veggies taste fresh, and salt from the meats amplifies that freshness. The whole dish is a brilliant bland of all tastes and colors, a great way to energize your day.

The temperature of the vanilla latte I ordered is well-handled that I was able to sip it as soon as it came to me. 

The setting of the place is great too, it receives just enough sunlight to make you feel refreshed without becoming too hot.
If you decide to visit the Botanic Gardens in the morning, be sure to check this place out!

p.s. the platter is big enough to feed 2 adults; so, if you are only there for breakfast, order with cautionMore"

The Line,"Seafood, Asian",emikosmum,5,We had our 3rd wedding anniversary celebration at The Line restaurant. We were welcomed warmly and promptly by the staff. Menu can be ordered online and the delivery of dishes was efficiently and conveniently done. The variety of dishes was commendable and the taste was very satisfying. Special thanks to Nelson for being so attentive to the needs of our toddler. He gave our daughter some crayons and colouring book to work on.

The Line,"Seafood, Asian",Chiajenny,5,"Stay 2D1N at Shangri-la on 7th-8th Nov and tried out the dinner buffet at The Line. I informed the service crew, Ameen, that my elder daughter has gluten and yeast allergy - he is very careful and merticulous to check every food item and highlight to us possible allergens in certain dishes even if minimal so my daughter wanted to eat so that she can in peace and we can be assured too. We are touched by him going the extra mile for us and the kitchen chef/crew for checking for us. Despite him wearing a mask, we can feel his friendliness and warmth in his service and must praise him for his excellent service. 

We had a hoo-ha episode when my daughter vomited and we felt really bad to soiled the napkin and dirtied the glass, but both Ameen and Eugene assured us that we need not worry about the mess and helped us with the mess. Eugene even thoughtfully got my girl a cup of warm water for her to drink after we came back aftermath cleaning her up. 

As the hotel staff knew we were celebrating mine and my younger daughter's birthday, they even prepared a birthday cake and sang us a birthday song. 

Greatly appreciate these thoughtful little gestures that make our dining experience a great and memorable one. Highly recommended to dine here for the excellent service! 

Well done, Ameen and Eugene, keep up the wonderful work and your positive attitude! May God bless you both and the rest of the service and kitchen crew!More"

The Line,"Seafood, Asian",tanshenchin,3,"Reservation service is tip top no glitch on that.
Dinning Experiences: 

Food menu is quite limited especially Japanese Cuisine. If you have been to the Line before Covid, you will notice the selection of food is a lot less this time round. 

Due to Covid safety rule, diners are to order their food from phone apps and the waitress will serve you the food. The phone app is easy to use but still got room of improvement  The food is served promptly probably there are a lot less diners around on the Tuesday night.
 
One big disappointment is that you need to pay for extra for the drinks. For a Can of Coke 320ml it is S$8. 

Dessert selection is decent enough. 

For the current limited food range selection, the pricing does not justified for it.  I will not recommend to visit THE LINE for buffet  till they improve the food menu."

Fat Belly,Steakhouse,agoh69,3,"A bit overrated by many reviews here. Tried to bring my colleagues here to help experience but kind of disappointing! Supposed to be a great place for grilled meat like beef and pork. Beef was great but the pork collar kind of too dry , chewy and overly cooked! I can‚Äôt even finish my food for first time! Appetisers like truffle fries, kale, bake Camembert cheese was great but the charcuterie board kind of average. The duck rilletes rather dry for you to spread on the toasted sourdough! Disappointing is that this restaurant don‚Äôt waive corkage even you ordered wines from them and the restaurant is rather cramped! Table for 6 inside the restaurant kind too squeeze for you to enjoy your dinner! You can chose better value restaurants serving the same food in town to be honest..service is attentive but it really took a ping time for them to find the wine we ordered!More"

Service was very good.. thanks to Fahmi and Esther who are extremely friendly and personable üòÄ.. will definitely be back for the food, coffees and awesome service!More"
Fat Belly,Steakhouse,joelhz,5,"Had an reservation for 9pm on a Friday eve for 4pax and the place was packed to the rim. 
For starters we only ordered some sour dough bread, which was beautifully charred. For steaks we went with the Denver, Onglet and Deckle cut, all medium rare. For sides we got truffle fries, creamed kale and pomme pur√©e. The steaks and sides arrived after around 20 mins and oh boy, they were perfect. Denver and onglet cut both were tender and extremely flavorful, perfect for steak lovers who chase beefy flavor. The Deckle cut is more suited for steak ‚Äûnewbies‚Äú or just people who prefer a more tender, less beefier cut of beef as it was marbled perfectly and melted with the touch of your tongue. We also had sauces, the salsa verde, bordelaise and green peppercorn. All were tasty but none were needed because the steaks by themselves were already flavorful and tasty enough. Truffle fries were outstanding, crispy thin and truffly. The pomme pur√©e was smooth and creamy with a hint of olive oil added to it. The flavor of the creamed kale was also very nice but I personally prefer creamed spinach over creamed kale because of its texture. For dessert we went with all 4 possible options. They all were outstanding but for me, the hazelnut chocolate creme took the cake as it was chocolaty, creamy and crunchy at the same time. The sticky date pudding, for me, came in second. It‚Äôs the closest thing you can get to a lava cake at the restaurant as it was served hot with some ice cream on the side. Cheesecake and Tiramisu also were better than you would normally expect.

In conclusion, Fat Belly is a great choice for anyone who enjoys a marvelous wagyu steak but refuses to pay 100$+ for it. Booking in advance is probably going to be mandatory though ;)More"
Fat Belly,Steakhouse,1234Kpo,3,"The beef is fantastic! Blackmore Full blood wagyu MS9+. Not cheap of course. Baked cheese is ok, but the option doesn‚Äôt come with bread, you have to order separately. Not sure how to eat cheese without bread. Interesting rabbit food as a main. The mash was awesome, but the portion is sooooo small, yet not cheap. 

Most disappointing has to be the wine list. Super limited choices and not great choices. The pairing by the sommelier is only good on knowledge, I guess he/she didn‚Äôt taste the food at all. We went with the recommendation for pairing but totally disappointment. 

Very small restaurant. Only 2 tables for 4 and over pax indoor. Or ‚Äòbar seats‚Äô. All other tables are outdoor."
Fat Belly,Steakhouse,tessashimi,5,"Fat Belly has impeccable service and a stylish, intimate setting. We ate our food at the bar, an appropriate distance away from each other for the purposes of social distancing. The food came quickly and was DELICIOUS. Our sides came first. The creamed kale was my partner‚Äôs favourite and mine was the pomme puree. The pomme puree in particular was a smooth, buttery, perfect side for the tender, juicy and flavourful steaks (we had the Deckle and Denver) that was our main course. The cheesecake we had for dessert was also impeccable. It melted in the mouth and had the perfect touch of sweetness. I absolutely would love to come here again."
Fat Belly,Steakhouse,al5un,5,"The steaks we had here were excellent. The cuts were of great quality (I personally preferred the tenderness of the Deckle) and they were cooked to textbook perfection. We wanted to try something different, so we opted for the Creamed Kale and Pomme Puree instead of the Truffle Fries.  Both were great but I enjoyed the kale more because it nicely soaked up the sauce while still retaining its crunchiness. The burnt cheesecake we shared for dessert was also delicious, and we felt the berries and honey were a nice touch to compliment the rich creaminess of the cake. All in all, a great meal. Highly recommended."
Fat Belly,Steakhouse,nameaintcarlos,5,"Had a chance to try out Fat Belly at Serene Center. They focus on the not so common cuts of meat, so I wasn‚Äôt familiar with most of the menu. Had the 250 gram deckle and that plus the creamed kale was pretty damn good, more than filling for someone that came in hungry. Surprising to see a 52-seater place with about 30-40 people around on a Tuesday night, which is a good testament to the quality of their food. Had a good look at the kitchen because I was seated at a bar and chef runs a clean and efficient outfit, without much waiting time for food. It was a bit of a blast in the past to eat at that mall because I used to live in that hood 20 years ago and never would have thought they‚Äôd have a steakhouse at SC! It‚Äôs not crazy expensive either, steaks ranging from 22++ to 62++, and you can tack on an extra 17 for a side and dessert. I want to try their lunch menu next time I go, though, because wagyu beef cheek rendang also sounds like a real winner. Pretty curious about the pork collar main for dinner as well. Will definitely be back."
Fat Belly,Steakhouse,RoiDesHarengs,5,"Amazing meat, nice variety of sides, good dessert, great service, wonderful ambiance, very soft paper towels.

Best steak I had in my life. I‚Äôm far from calling myself a steak connoisseur, but this steak is unforgettable. I‚Äôm writing this review and I‚Äôm literally salivating. It was so tender and juicy. Great use of the hot plate to keep the meat warm throughout the whole meal. On more technical terms, my dining partner and I got 2 medium-rare steaks, both 400 Day Grain Fed F1 Wagyu with a Marble Score of 4/5. One was the Deckle cut and the other, the Denver. The two amateurs that we are both preferred the Deckle, but more gourmet taste buds may claim otherwise.

We had a hard time to pick two sides out of the options Fat Belly offers, but we opted for the Truffle Fries and Saut√©ed Thyme Mushroom. Both sides were nicely complementing the meat, and the portions were generous. However, while we were gobbling our fragrant truffle fries, perched from the seats by the bar, we had a peek at a side of cream kale in the making and the temptation was real. I was satisfied with the sides we got, but I would definitely try other promising ones next time!

For dessert, we had a slice of cheesecake, light and flavourful, accompanied with a scoop of strawberry coulis and a drizzle of passion fruit sauce. The perfect way to end a delicious meal.

Fat Belly‚Äôs location, right by Botanic Gardens, is very convenient for a date, and the ambiance was great for a Tuesday night. I had a soft spot for the music they were playing which just made everything better. On a side note, as a foreigner, you quickly realise how astoundingly hard it is to obtain paper towels in Singapore during meals. Fat Belly indeed has paper towels, and not any paper towels, only the SOFTEST, a real slice of cloud."
Fat Belly,Steakhouse,sk_rh_eats,4,"Fat Belly brands itself as an alternative steakhouse serving up cuts of beef you‚Äôd be hard pressed to find anywhere else. Located on the first floor of Serene Centre with both indoors and bistro seating, Fat Belly is a great place for convivial meals with friends and family, and a pretty great date spot (located 5min from Botanic Gardens).

My dining partner and I went on a Tuesday evening, and it was pretty crowded - reservations definitely recommended. We were seated at the bar, which gave us a great view of the steaks being grilled.

Fat Belly‚Äôs menu is pared down, but the dishes, from starters to sauces, bear evidence of thoughtful flavour pairings. Between the two of us, we got 2 medium-rare steaks, both 400 Day Grain Fed F1 Wagyu with a Marble Score of 4/5. One was the Deckle cut and the other, the Denver. According to our server, the Deckle is a brisket-like cut, and the Denver is from the shoulder. Both are supposed to have great marbling without being overly fatty.

Our steaks were grilled, lightly seasoned with coarse salt, and served with a single grilled vine tomato. Pinkish-red on the inside with an even grill on the outside, the steaks were a perfect medium-rare. Being slightly fattier and more tender, the Deckle was the clear favourite between the two. But that being said, the Denver was a deliciously chewy steak due to the proximity of the cut to the shoulder. At this point it‚Äôs down to a matter of personal preference.

We also got two sides to share: Truffle Fries and Saut√©ed Thyme Mushroom Medley. Sides here come in generous portions, so if you could only get one we‚Äôd recommend the mushroom medley - you can‚Äôt go wrong with thick-sliced mushrooms saut√©ed with garlic, onions, and thyme. The mushrooms were flavourful and a nice accompaniment to our steaks. The Truffle Fries came with a generous heaping of parmesan and a dash of fragrant truffle oil.

We finished off our meal with a dessert, Basque Burnt Cheesecake. It reminded us of our steaks, being ‚Äúgrilled‚Äù on the outside and creamy within. The cheesecake was drizzled over with tart passionfruit sauce, a tiny spoonful of strawberry preserves and some crumbled cookies. It didn‚Äôt have quite the oomph of the sides and mains but we enjoyed it nevertheless - great sweet end to a hearty meal.

Fat Belly is a steakhouse with alternative cuts that aren‚Äôt just a gimmick. A meal here will set you back about $100+ if you spring for the most expensive cuts paired with starters, sides and dessert, but the quality of the food is assured. Definitely one for the revisit list!More"

MTR Singapore,"Indian, Healthy",Raja19_pal,3,"Food here is decent but little expensive for a South Indian, not a fine dining restaurant. They are no where closer to the authentic food that they serve at Bangalore in India. MTR is well known for their masala dosa, bisibellebath and filter coffee but here it is pretty average. Waiters and cashiers are rude as they rush you to finish your food and leave quickly. It‚Äôs a place where you can eat once in a while, not a place to go frequently."

MTR Singapore,"Indian, Healthy",rajeshprabhu76,3,"The food is very good but the cashiers are rude. Sometimes I feel as though I am having the food for free. We need to place the order in hurry. They do not even allow us to take a breather after finishing our food. My family was waiting for me at the table, keeping a watch on my bag, while I had gone to wash my hands.  The cashier checked with my family if they have completed the meal, in a tone signaling my family to vacate the place immediately. My friends have also experienced rude behavior by the cashier when they visited the restaurant. The waiters on the other hand are extremely polite and well mannered."
MTR Singapore,"Indian, Healthy",iammanishg,4,"Love the food here. The best part is that the quality is consistently maintained and they seldom disappoint. Today we ordered BisiBele Bhath and Pudi Idly. Both tasted great with the right amount of spices. 

However, was disappointed with Badam Halwa which didn‚Äôt meet my expectation. I wanted my regular Kesari Bhath, but unfortunately, it got over so had to settle with the above.

Overall a great place to taste authentic South Indian food."

Prego,"Italian, Pizza",Ernestichiro,5,"Ordered the grilled squid and Hokkaido scallops for starters, NY Strip and grilled lobster for mains with creamed spinach as a side.

Grilled squid and scallops done perfectly, caulliflower puree which came with the scallops was super tasty.

Beef came medium rare as ordered, with that chargrilled smoky taste that made it super good. Lobster was a good size, ordered the grilled one instead of the thermidor to taste the sweetness of the meat and it did not disappoint. Juicy!

Service and hospitality was impeccable, crew came to check on us every now and then to ensure all was in order and our expectations were met. Thank you Chef Wan and team for the awesome dinner service, and also to crew Joel, Dana, Q and Ariessa for looking after us and for being ever so attentive.

The staff did not even buy time and goodwill w a free salad or bowl of soup. Totally inapt. Table next to us got their food before us and they were seated 20 mins after us. 
The guy that seated us was unhappy and long faced. I made a reservation and requested a table. When I got there, he wanted us to sit at the counter altho there were 3 tables available.

665¬∞F,Steakhouse,Travel10036864965,3,"We ordered
1 6 course
1 2 X uni with ikura
1 oyster shooter
And 2 greeb teas

Spend $266+

What piss me off 
Seasonal sashimi could have informed me of fish sperms
Cutting half size sashimi for scallop is a big no no! And tiny size sashimi fish cuts.

Oyster uni shooter is a bit on the expansive side. $20 is fair not $24. 

2 type of uni with ikura rice is a ripe off. For the amount of uni given. It felt like a $48 bowl at most.

Ambience is terrible. Should have told me about the more vip place of sitting since im spending almost $300. 

Return?
For these prices. Nope. I felt the fair value is about 2/3 of what i had."

The Ramen Stall,"Japanese, Sushi",estherchin181,3,"Food is wonderful but service standard has room for improvement. We were given a private area which was great, but the service is kind of slow. Not too sure is it because we were in the private area, which we were kind of being neglected."

The Ramen Stall,"Japanese, Sushi",Roger T,5,"I love the excellent service as well as the food. However, I'm sure it will be better if the portion of the food can be slightly more. Whereas for the beverages, the costing is too high. May be the management like to consider a review."
Mitzo,"Chinese, Asian",Tingxz,2,"It was a gathering with a group of 8. Made reservation via quandoo and when we got there, we had to sit separately in a table of 6 and 2. We had to ask the person to rearrange for us, he was abit reluctant at first. And after a while, he decided to make the arrangement for us which is possible. 

Next, I check with him what entertainer app 1-4-1 dishes are we entitled to. He told us one table only able to use one coupon. From my many years of using entertainer app, coupons are based on number of pax. Logically speaking, 8 pax is allowed to use 4 coupons, but the boss told us one table only allowed to use one coupon. WHAT? 
For those intending to use entertainer app there with large groups, please do not go there! 

Next, we asked for the bill 4 times and it didn‚Äôt come to us.
The restaurant is not very busy at that timing, however I‚Äôm not too sure why the bill took so long to come. There was once we asked for the bill again , the boss was too busy trying to get customer inside their restaurant, he just glance at us and ignore. After which he just continue to do his things and we got to go to the counter and ask for the bill for the 5th time. He even pass the wrong bill to the wrong table?! 

Besides all the bad reviews on the service, the food in general is not too bad.

But I‚Äôll not go back to this place again. Feels like we are not respected as customer at all."

The ambiance is casually sexy w/ chill background music. The wagyu burger is absolutely perfect w a glass of an affordable Shiraz. To start, you must try the Burrata w/ Figs ( also includes olive tapenade) & plenty of arugula to share. 
The lamb was so so. 
Karen was on point as far as service was concerned. Energetic, polite, professional & a welcoming smile. 
I also appreciated the complimentary cool glass of water as soon as I sat at the table‚Äî very American. A small detail most restaurants in Singapore overlook. Overall, a solid experience. Thank you, WINESTONE !More"

We visited on a weekday afternoon, and there was 1-for-1 for all mains as well. The atmosphere was wonderful; fancy and tranquil ambience without being too formal. The part that impressed us the most, was that we actually went there for a birthday lunch, and without even requesting for it, they surprised us with a small cheesecake and birthday song. It was a superbly classy and relaxing experience. Would definitely recommend!!More"

Winestone,"Bar, European",thecenz1,5,"Great execution, every dish was succulent and perfectly cooked/prepared. Impeccable service. Great wine pairing. Atmosphere in the restaurant is luxurious but still very modern. 
Only downside for me was not really seeing the culinary story line in the succession of dishes. It felt more of a stack rather than a progression of tastes."
Winestone,"Bar, European",YvesC919,5,Great lunch to celebrate French national day paired with fantastic wines. Each dish was a unique experience. Enjoy 3+hrs at Odette!
Winestone,"Bar, European",marquishalu,5,"Chef Julien, I blame you and your impeccable team for spoiling me and raising my dining standards to an unreasonably high one.

Full disclosure, my memory is slightly impaired because the wine pairing was so phenomenal I had to empty every glass while making sure I properly ration every bite to accompany every sip.  

The thoughtfulness of their staff is more meticulous than anyone who has gotten me a gift. They even reminded us to pace ourselves and take bathroom breaks to make more space for more goodies. And as you can probably tell, they have a delightful sense of humour as well that left us very entertained (and wiser from their knowledge they were so passionately sharing). 

What I do remember clearly is feeling wonderfully surprised by all the flavours in every single dish. The complexity and layers of flavour that simply does not stop bursting in your mouth with every chew. Pretty sure their desserts are exactly what rainbows taste like.

If I really do have to knitpick, their bread and accompanying olive oil has room for improvement. But their slightly lacking bread also meant I managed to not stuff my face with carbs, leaving more room to savour the fine edible art served elegantly on unique plates. 

9.9/10 recommend instead of the perfect ten because I am officially an embarassing and hopeless fan girl of Chef Julien and his team at Odette. 

 
P.s. I wish I had better documentation of the courses but I didn‚Äôt have enough discipline to resist the food."
Winestone,"Bar, European",ShannieLu,5,"This is my fifth visit, previously also ordered 'Odette at Home' twice. I have nothing but the highest praises for this lovely restaurant and its outstanding team, and I look forward to being back again. 

Food 
The level of consistency in taste and presentation is astounding. Right from my first visit back in early 2016, I knew right away Odette would make it big and I'm really happy for them that they have.  Trondheim bay scallops, rosemary smoked organic egg, foie gras comme un pho, and crispy scaled Kinki are some of my favourites. To me, I really enjoyed being able to taste the freshness and quality of all the ingredients used, without being overwhelmed by excessive salt. 

Desserts and Cheese
Yes they deserve a special mention too. The yuzu tart with basil sorbet was extremely light and refreshing, and I couldn't have asked for a better end to the meal. Their caneles always have me wanting more. Cheese selection was really impressive with more than 20 to choose from. We got 4 different kinds of cheese and they were served with a truffle salad and some slices of sourdough and fig bread. Cheese lovers' paradise. 

Wine
I previously always brought my own wines (1-1 corkage). Finally got to try their wine pairing today and it was a massive hit. Two pairings really stood out - the Ink Grade Vineyard Zinfandel that was served with the Heirloom Beetroot, and the Herve Bizeul Roussillon from Domaine du Clos de Fees with the Kampot Pepper Crusted Pigeon. The former pairing was a bold choice which I was slightly skeptical at first but I was so, so impressed by how the wine elevated the different flavours in this dish. Bear in mind this is the 6th time I've had this dish so I wasn't expecting to be surprised, but boy I was blown away. The Herve Bizeul is a beautiful wine that's perfect even on its own - and it matched so dynamically with the pigeon breast and leg that I polished the food and wine in no time even though I was already quite full. Kudos to the sommeliers behind this brilliant wine pairing program. Strongly recommend going for wine pairing. 

Cocktails
Severely underrated. Not a very big selection but they've got all the classics a decent bar should have. Never had a Jacquemot before and ordered one to try. World class. 

Service 
Absolutely impeccable. The level of attention to detail is mind blowing. Hand sanitizer for every guest. Each time you leave your seat you'd come back to a fresh napkin handed out using thongs. Glasses never empty. If you hug your arms someone would come check if the temperature is okay. Not just the sommeliers are well versed in wines - every single staff knows the food and wine inside out, including the stories behind them. You can tell everyone's genuinely happy and proud to be working there. Even the masks they wear can't hide their smiles.

Odette at Home
Ingredients are carefully sealed in individual air tight bags and placed in beautiful boxes. You'll need to do some simple heating up either over the stove or in the oven (detailed instructions provided). I was surprised that flavours weren't compromised at all and everything tasted divine.

Thank you
To Chef Julien, thanks for your generosity and hospitality. It was such a magical meal that I'll always remember with a huge smile. To Jacque, thank you for handling our booking, the warm welcome and arranging the celebratory dessert. To Vincent and the other sommelier who served us, thank you for sharing interesting winemaker stories and giving us a crash course on wine. To Zachary and fellow Taiwaneses, I'm truly inspired by your passions in hospitality and I wish Singapore continues to treat you well. To Geoffrey, thank you for being super attentive and humorous. To Si En, thank you for being extremely sweet and hospitable. I didn't manage to get some of your names and I wish I did so I could thank you all individually. 

Till next time, Odette."
Winestone,"Bar, European",krystalis,1,"Due to Covid-19, dining in at restaurants is currently not allowed. We decided to try the ""Odette at Home"" delivery option for our wedding anniversary dinner. 

Disappointingly, the dinner was never delivered, despite the order being made hours before the delivery time slot. The order was supposed to be delivered between 7.30-8pm. By 8.15pm, when the dinner was still not delivered, I tried calling the restaurant's phone number multiple times, but it was turned off. By 9pm, we were resigned that having a nice French dinner for our wedding anniversary was not going to happen. In the end, we had to get fast food for dinner. 

I just hope that the restaurant will refund me the pricey dinner which I had paid for via my credit card. 

I doubt that I will try 'Odette at Home' ever again."

Service right from the start was great -- we gave our reservation name at the counter on the ground floor, and was directed to level 57 of the MBS hotel. We had to change lifts at level 55, and being unfamiliar with the place, we needed some further prodding from the people around to get our bearings, haha.

Once we arrived at level 57 and the lift doors opened, the smiling staff of Spago was right there waiting for us already. After a quick temperature check (this being the pandemic period), we were led into the restaurant. Oh wow, the view even as we walked along the exterior length of the restaurant was amazing. The MBS Infinity Pool is right there, and on a clear day, a view of the city beyond. The restaurant itself is flooded with natural light, which I absolutely love. Both sides boasted full-length window/doors, and it made the interior very bright and welcoming indeed. 

The servers are prompt and polite, and knowledgeable about their menus. Gave many good recommendations for both the food and the drinks, and I must say their Prix Fixe set lunch menu is very impressive. I'm used to set lunch menus being limited to only 3 or 4 options, but here at Spago, there were a good 8 options for both the starter and the main course. Oh, and they sure don't skimp on the serving either, just because it's a set lunch. We were served bread -- really nice! -- and then the 3-course we'd ordered individually, and by the end of it, all of us were very much satisfied and sated. Specifically, the Grilled Iberico Pork Pressa I had for my main was downright delightful. The meat was so perfectly done, tender and juicy, it would've been easy to forget that this is pork and not some premium red meat!

I'm really pleased with my experience here. I'd recommend it -- at least for the Prix Fixe menu which is really good-value for such an establishment too!More"

Spago Dining Room by Wolfgang Puck,"American, European",horatiojml,2,"We had high expectations going into Yan Ting. We are fans of the Mandarin Oriental Chinese resto so exited/hoped for same level of dining. Boy were we wrong. 

Positives: 
-good looking room
-above avg service

Negatives:
-THE FOOD
1. The venison was overcooked (we sent it back). It tasted and looked like a school canteen meal. See pic
2. Ordered both the Kurubuta Spanish pork char siu and the honeyglazed (regular) pork bc we wanted to try them both and compare. Mistake. They are both smothered in the exact same sauce so can‚Äôt differentiate. Sign of a weak chef when he he feels the need to ‚Äúhide‚Äù the taste/quality of the underlying meat (esp for the former which is 50% more $$$). That‚Äôs the strategy of a buffet resto. See pic
3. Crab w: asparagus was really just asparagus drenched in a sauce interspersed with what we think was crab but not sure as there wasn‚Äôt much. See pic

The main problem is that all food items are 2-3x more $$$ vs alert tier canto resto. But the quality/taste isn‚Äôt better. Our bill was over $400 (2p and only 2 beers) for a lacklustre and disappointing meal. Fortunately we had the Amex 50% off deal so soothed the head shaking but we kept saying who wld be dumb engh to pay the regular prices for this meal?!?!

Another reminder (as is often said) to never follow Michelin guide."

Spago Dining Room by Wolfgang Puck,"American, European",Safari300798,5,"We are back at Yan Ting for a dinner get together the other day. Took us a while to make a reservation as the ever popular place is booked through the last 2 weeks. But am glad we finally made it back here.

As we are celebrating our birthdays (yes all Nov babies!) we decided to be nice to ourselves !

The ever attentive and helpful Karen helped us selected the dishes for tonight. We had peking duck, roast pork belly, steamed bamboo clam and soup.

The food is delicious and is just nice for us. Karen's recommendations is always very good and she also ensured that there is no wastage :)

The other crew were also very attentive and always help to top up our drinks.

We had a very cosy and happy get together over dinner, thanks to the attentive crew.

Next time if you don't know what to have for dinner and looking for good Chinese cuisine, do pop by to Yan Ting and I am sure the crew there will he happy to suggest a few dishes for your enjoyment."

I felt the offerings could be a little more adventurous, a little less ‚Äúmass market‚Äù.  Perhaps I shouldn‚Äôt have ordered the set menu again ?

Few years ago there was already a significant amount of competition.  Today there‚Äôs even more.  It would take a substantial amount of courage for me to want to visit here again any time soon    but that‚Äôs me.  If you like Cantonese food, you will like the food.  No problem.

The visit with 3 very dear friends 7 days ago was on the evening of the shutdown in Singapore of all dining establishments. We could not have had a better time to see the #stayathome in Singapore commence from 23:59 that night.

It was another wonderful experience and the new Executive Chef; Giuseppe bringing that truly authentic Italian atmosphere to the place.

We were superbly looked after by Martin and Massimo.

Fantastic delicious food, with my favorite fine red wine and cocktails to end the night. Awesome experience.

THANK YOU MONTI team. See you in May after the Lock-down."
Yan Ting,"Chinese, Asian",larislong,5,"It started with a surprise starters of a burrata cheese which was so creamy and garnish of sweet baby tomatoes. 
Then came an exotic dish of slow cooked egg.. timed with perfection with the yolk oozing out with every scoop and topped with aromatic truffles and great taste of roasted mushrooms & cauliflower.
Then came the main dish of medium rare  iberico pork plum that's crispy and charred just nice on the outside and juicy on the inside and I am sure it's seasoned with liquor because it's so delicious. 
Finally my favourite tiramisu that's so beautiful looking and filled with so much taste  
Such nice ambience like eating above the sea and over looking the beautiful view of MBS and with such enjoyable and delicious food makes me feel like going again tomorrow.

The burrata was fresh and creamy and paired well with the soil and basil caviar. The halibut was done to perfection. The sauce was delicious and I have no idea how the Chef got the broccolini to taste that good. The tiramisu unfortunately had too much coffee which overpowered the dessert. My dining companion loved her porchetta. I found it strange that they didn‚Äôt have any wine/cocktail specials for restaurant week so we ordered al a carte. All in all a wonderful afternoon."

I've held many special occasions here, referred many companies over looking for venue spaces, and recommended this place to close friends when they're looking for something special. Each and every one of them have walked away saying how much they've loved Monti. Was last here for Felix's degustation menu a few days ago and he blew me away as usual. If you're looking for an unbeatable scenery, ambience, top quality of food, and value for your $, Monti is quite literally the only restaurant on Marina Bay where you find all these qualities in one."

Yan Ting,"Chinese, Asian",nycy12345,3,"Gave 3 stars because my first visit was excellent but last visit left much to be desired. 

First visit was during restaurant week, during which I'd visited multiple restaurants. This was the best by far. Angus steak was done to perfection and everyone at the table agreed it was probably the one of the best (top 2/3) steaks we've had in Singapore. 

Second visit was pretty good, but did not order steak so can't compare. Nothing to complain about. This was around August/ early Sept too. 

Third visit was on a la carte menu, this was circa Sept. This visit was very disappointing. Spent much more on food than the first visit given that there was no promotion. We assumed the quality would be the same or better. Ordered the steak which was mediocre. Risotto was average. Not sure what changed, maybe cost cutting because of COVID? Please get the standards back up, I loved the old Monti. Stunning atmosphere, and incredible value during restaurant week  Ironic that the more expensive meal was much poorer. Pity too, because the latter meal was for a birthday celebration."

MONTI,Italian,Wongrsg,5,"To be frank, Ma Cuisine is not for everybody. After seating in the beautiful place who reminds you France chic bistrot you don‚Äôt get to choose your food. No, here it is a wine bar, so you have to choose your wine first, and then they will guide you to pair at best your beverages, brilliant, especially for wine lovers like us. 

The service staff is helpful and the sommelier knows his wine , passionate to the fullest. I have never encountered someone like him before, and I can understand some people feel uncomfortable as he real live his thing, one of kind for sure. 

The food menu is short but it is clearly on a high quality standards, you can read caviar, truffle, and lobster. Welcome to French food at best. The prices are according to the quality you get, faultless dishes with outstanding taste, ++++ 

The combo of the wine, food and atmosphere is barely seen elsewhere, the magic is real and you really enjoy your time, this is simple but precise. 

I have read a few other comment and I can tell some people are plain stupid, who would come in a wine bar without drinking wine ????? It is like going in a steakhouse and being vegan -_-

After all it is good this place keep lowkey as it is a real gem. 

Congrats to all of the team to bring a big chunk of France in Singapore."

For dessert, rice pudding with salted caramel. Overall food quality is 7.5 and taste 7.

What is lacking hoewever is good old customer service from a couple of the local waiters. A simple courtesy of friendliness would even made a difference. They were rather curt
and considering (on phase 2), an inconsistent/disregard use of face masks should be implemented both by the kitchen and service staff. Supervisors/manager on duty were superb,  came for some friendly chats to various tables. 

Overall, the ambience of the restaurant is homely and sweetly  tucked in a heritage building. If you're craving for a french cuisine, this is worth a try if you're around the Chinatown/Tanjong Pagar area.

Note. Missed a couple of pics on the soup and dessert."

Winestone,"Bar, European",GlobetrotterRu,5,"We love coming to Manhattan because service is always warm and friendly and it feels like home. Tim and Alson made our drinks tonight and we love that they had ideas about what spirit, bitters or liqueur went better with a particular cocktail we chose .Justin was our waiter the last time we visited; he remembered us and popped by to say hi, which is amazing because they must get a lot of guests! 

And of course the drinks are fabulous and the ambience cosy (they have a Christmas tree in the corner for the festive season, which works well with the leather sofas and wood paneling). We like the redemption burger and the clam chowder (full of goodness!)

Do pay them a visit when you are next in Singapore, hopefully this year if borders re-open."

Winestone,"Bar, European",meanderingsoles,5,One of the best bars I‚Äôve been to in Singapore. The decor is from a prohibition era New York speakeasy and the bar area is one of the classiest I‚Äôve seen. They have an extensive cocktail menu with drinks from different decades. The interesting part is their menu of aged cocktails which I‚Äôve never seen before. I had the New York sour which was their take in a whisky sour. Really well thought of cocktail. It‚Äôs a bit pricey but the service and quality of drinks make it worth it.

Winestone,"Bar, European",areisende,5,"Our nth time to Manhattan -- a sophisticated bar with equally sophisticated, complex drinks. Ask for Frank -- he is the best bartender there: friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate. We have tried drinks made by other bartenders (other past visits), and if you order a classic or a drink from the menu, it would be ok, but if you ask them to create a drink (e.g. based on whiskey or gin or something not too sweet etc), it wouldn't be that good. But Frank knocks perfect cocktails. Those from the menu and classics -- he will of course get them right, but ask him to create one for you -- I asked for something a little sweet and sour, not too strong on the alcohol and he created this amazing, smooth, complex drink of pineapple and apricot and gin based. AMAZING. Most bartenders would create something lemon or yuzu inspired, but he did something different. And that was just one of many drinks had made for us -- all very much enjoyed.

Food is always good -- try the lobster mini sliders or snow crab taco (or is it the other way round!), though slightly pricey. 

Service is generally very good, but occasionally, on busy nights, and with no reservations, some staff can be slightly condescending and frosty. 

All round, one of our favourite bars and it has continued to be our favourite."

Every single staff was super helpful, particularly when I mentioned I couldn't have pork/lard. The nice waiter even picked out another chilli sauce that I could have - I'm truly grateful.

My husband has the set lunch, and I ordered some dim sum, the wagyu beef, foie gras with caviar as well as the prawn noodles with superior broth. Every single dish was presented beautifully on top of being tasty! I honestly was too full for dessert, but they presented a divine flower jelly with mango puree that was so yummy I couldn't help but have it all. 

Totally worth it - we'd make the trip to Sentosa just for a meal at Cassia."

I was pregnant and jokingly teased my husband for taking the last piece away from me. It was just a passing remark and I thought no one else beside my husband heard me. I intended to order another portion of that dish but even before I could Bryan appeared with another portion of that dish and served it to us!! He insisted it was on the house as he couldn‚Äôt let a pregnant lady not eat what she want! I was so touched by his gesture, but more amazed at how meticulous and thoughtful he was! 

Later we also realised that throughout the course of our meal we never needed to ask for his help because he always manages to anticipate our needs!

The fava is fantastic, the sea bass was well-prepared and they even de-bone it for you, the desserts like their rice pudding are marvelous .The drinks are a little short on variety, while there are a number of Greek options like wine etc which is great, if you feel like just having a nice single malt or an interesting cocktail - the options are extremely limited. We had to re-order some things a few times because a male server wearing a pink shirt missed it out, he also seemed to have an attitude for no reason and was rather rude. The rest of the staff were super friendly though giving it a homely vibe.

He was cheerful and added ‚Äúperhaps you might wanna get a half portion instead of a usual portion so that you could try more stuff?‚Äù   This was great advice!

When the bread was served, it was crusty on the outside and moist yet warm on the inside smelling of olive oil. Lovely.

The house white was a good pairing and as we were enjoying the evening, Calvin appeared with dessert and limoncello and even an extra shot digestive which added sparkle to the evening.

BAKALAKI Greek Taverna,"Mediterranean, Greek",HuiMin C,2,"Contrary to what many sites and even this site itself says, this place does not have wifi. So no, it is not what timeout claimed. That's not the reason for the average rating tho. They do have plenty of charging points which are ideal, the music is relaxing (until I was the only table left so they turn off the music and the lights, cost-saving?), food was great and reasonably priced. So why the poor rating? Service was rather non existent, not the friendliest and welcoming bunch. i have sat there for a long while so maybe I overstayed my welcome as I took more than couple of hours to finish my bottle of wine. The whole switching off all the lights and music sort of left me feeling like a second class citizen or a pest that has intruded a quiet afternoon. The crude tone of voice didn‚Äôt help either. Perhaps I didn't spend enough for a better service, perhaps if I had appear here with a friend things would have been better."

Wine & Chef,"Wine Bar, Fusion",Telomeke,2,"I just had a bit of a horrifying experience.  The food was well-cooked and well-presented, and it was tasty.  The menu-writer had taken pains to highlight which foods were gluten-free.  But what is incomprehensible to me is -- after explaining very clearly to the waiter that I had to eat gluten-free -- another waiter then plonked down in front of me the amuse bouche (which I hadn't ordered) -- it was a sliver of foie gras on a suspicious-looking biscuit.  So I asked if the biscuit was gluten-free, and the waiter insisted that it was. He was VERY insistent.  Only after repeated questioning did he go back to the kitchen to check.  And only after a stretch of time did he return (more than enough time for a customer to swallow a very inviting amuse bouche), and unapologetically (and rather curtly) informed me that I should not be eating the biscuit after all, because it was a shortbread and NOT at all gluten-free.  I told him if I'd eaten it, it would have caused me all manner of problems -- and he did not seem in the least bit apologetic at having misled me in the first place.  I am most appalled that he could have got something so basic so wrong.  Not going back again -- the rest of the wait staff seemed OK, but this one guy was cavalier and unconcerned, which makes the intentions behind the whole menu with all its gluten-free and vegetarian symbols ring a bit hollow.  So unpleasant; ruined a fine evening for me."
Wine & Chef,"Wine Bar, Fusion",KGB777,4,"I came here for lunch with a friend in December 2019. We didn't have a reservation and wanted to use the Entertainer app. Apparently the rules were that a reservation is needed if the Entertainer app is to be used (although nowhere on the app is this idiosyncratic rule made clear). After some negotiation we were allowed in (since anyway the restaurant wasn't busy as it was a week day lunchtime). Everything else went smoothly and the bread and main courses were very good. I would just recommend that, if the restaurant chooses to participate in a particular app,  that it considers making rules such as this clear on the apps rather than informing the diners upon arrival. That would lead to a better all round experience for everyone."

Spago Bar & Lounge,"Bar, International",DennisLimSY,5,"I've always been a believer of you just need to be very good at one thing, and you will be very successful. For that reason, I've always been drawn to single-minded proposition eateries.

Shinji is a prime example of those. For an omakase or kaiseki restaurant, I think it's easy to want to try to do too much because there's so much to offer for Japanese cuisine, which can end up with very confused diners and even a confused identity. 

I guess that's how Shinji stands out from the crowd - by sticking true to its roots and stick to serving really good sushi."

The RANCH Steakhouse By ASTONS,"American, Steakhouse",Changjo88,5,A real treat for the family to dine at Rhubarb.  The experience lived up to every expectation.  The chef was kind enough prepare special variation for one of our picky eaters at the table.  The pace and service were well coordinated with each serving; special care for Covid safe dining.  Loved all the dishes and presentation explains why Rhubarb remains a highly recommended fine dining experience in Singapore.  Good selection of wines to complement the dining experience.
The RANCH Steakhouse By ASTONS,"American, Steakhouse",Lizzie B,4,"We chose this restaurant over all others due to its location to the hotel in which we were staying over new year. Yes, the Michelin star helped, as did some of the reviews but I didn't get too bogged down with the less flattering ones as I am well aware of personal preference/taste/expectations etc. My husband and I went purely for a fine dining experience and that is exactly what we got. I don't disagree that the decor was underwhelming and that the waiting staff appeared quite casual in appearance, but all that meant is that all our focus was on the food. It did not disappoint. I won't go on labouring any point in particular so will just state that if you eat with your eyes, each dish was beautifully presented. If taste is your thing, each ingredient stood out as a heavy weight in its own category. Some have said that the quality ingredients were diluted by the 'trimmings'. I disagree. I am always cautious with French food for that very reason but had no cause for concern here. I think that Paul cleverly ensured that each taste sensation was exactly as he had in mind; of course, that isn't going to suit every palate. We were a teetotal table but, after the first mishap of failing to pour our water (tap by the way), we were given as much attention as all other guests.  It is up to you to decide whether the level of attention you receive is enough - we prefer to be left alone without too much fuss.

Paul brought our foie gras to the table which was a nice gesture. He is busy, he didn't need to, we wouldn't have expected that but appreciated that he did. It was phenomenal. After eating my own body weight in homemade pate over Christmas I must admit, I was hesitant. But, it would be my top choice next time. My husband and I attempted to list each dish according to preference. Mine were foie gras, scallop and dessert all joint first and the pigeon, a close second. That should tell you something - if it doesn't, maybe wiping the plates clean with the bread does? Scandalous, I know!! 

Was this my first fine dining experience? Could it have been a one-off treat that I will never forget? Not even close. If you are going to feel good about where you are in life, to reinforce your level of success and to have your ego stroked as one who comes above all others, go elsewhere - if you hanker for a fine dinging experience but could do without all the pomp and ceremony that comes with it, this is your place!More"
The RANCH Steakhouse By ASTONS,"American, Steakhouse",Globa1Foodie,2,"We went to Rhubarb for a lunch with high expectations. The mushroom emulsion was simply fantastic, as was the celeriac pasta. The mango coconut dessert was boring. We thought we might end up a bit hungry with the 3 course menu ($52), so opted for the 4 course omakase menu ($88). Now the omakase menu was 69% more expensive than the regular menu, so we expected that the restaurat would have done their math right, that the quality / quantity of the omakase menu would justify the higher price. Instead, we got 3 items from the main lunch menu with a little salad added on that wasn't particularly special. I can't imagine I paid 69% extra for a little salad. Something is very wrong. If you go here for lunch, skip the omakase - just stick with the 3 course lunch."
The RANCH Steakhouse By ASTONS,"American, Steakhouse",Stephenstorey,1,"While the food was generally good the experience was spoilt by an appalling lack of customer service from the manager to deal effectively with a genuine complaint. Opting for wine pairing to accompany the set menu we were served with a glass of wine that had a ridiculous level of sediment in the glass. Why the restaurant feels the need to squeeze every last drop of wine out of a bottle without decanting is beyond me. Even worse failing to deal with the matter either by taking off the bill , removing the service charge or even offering a free cup of coffee instead simply I‚Äôm trying my best is not befitting of a Michelin Star restaurant.  There are better restaurants with far superior service. If you have a choice I highly recommend you avoid this one."
The RANCH Steakhouse By ASTONS,"American, Steakhouse",agoh69,4,Deserved it‚Äôs one star Michelin food serving the contemporary French cuisine. Great job Chef Paul! Great dining experience with set menu of 2 or 3 appetiser. The main course we had are between lamb or tooth fish. Quite a large serving for the main course and it is just enough for most of Asian stomach. The tooth fish is exceptionally tasty with beetroot and passionfruit ! The fried barramundi fish cooked in the corn soup with the sea shell was really nice. Exception the lamb as it still has strong gamey odour which I don‚Äôt typically like it. The meat kind of hard to my liking and less flavour probably the loin part of the lamb being used which leaner meat. The wine selection mostly from France label and you can pick a good one. The dessert was great even I don‚Äôt really fancy sweet stuff but I wipe it all! Choose the burgundy wine tonight and it was really good to pair with my food tonight.

Had questions about their menu so I contacted them via fb - and got a response quickly from Kenneth (the owner). He offered to substitute an item from a set menu due to dietary restrictions, which was appreciated. I told him it was for a milestone birthday and he reassured that he would deliver it personally. Ordering was a breeze, the food arrived on time, well packaged and chilled. My family raved about the dinner, my dad who hasn‚Äôt had sushi since Covid enjoyed his Chirashi very much. Perhaps his only gripe was he would have loved a little more wasabi on the side. Otherwise the food was delicious all around. Thank you En Sushi for making this easy for me!More"

En Sushi,"Japanese, Seafood",ervinayin,5,"We were anticipating the Peach Blossoms' reopening since December and read many great reviews since then.  With the Life and Style, by Meritus discount benefits, it was just like double happiness for us.

Our lunch and dinner here were just full of surprises, as classical dishes were transformed into creative and artful presentations.

We tried the signature dishes, dim sum and the desserts.  Highly recommended to pre-order the signature roasted dishes - Flambee Chinese Wine Spring Chicken and Sugarcane Smoked Kurobuta Pork Ribs.  There are many varieties of chinese tea and I've tried the Dragon Pearl and Bi Luo Chun.

Besides the food, the outstanding service from all the staff can hardly go unnoticed.  We were very well taken care of, from the reservation (phone/online form) to the best table assignment (window seat requested and given) and the food recommendation/serving.  This is by far the best customer service we've experienced in hotel restaurants in Singapore.  There wasn't a moment that our wine glasses or teapot were empty.  The staff were super-attentive at every moment and whenever we ask about any dishes, they were very well-trained in explaining the ingredients, preparation and serving method.  They even noted that I like taking pictures/videos, so they would wait I was ready before starting the flambee.  Special thanks to Mr. Roger and Ms. Swee Teng for taking good care of us during our dinner on Friday, 29th January.  Such level of professionalism is very commendable and should be the benchmark to all restaurants.  Kudos to the Management team!

We will gladly return, not just for the amazing food but most of all for the service that made us feel very much at home and as the valued customers."

Summer Palace,"Chinese, Asian",nycy12345,4,"Food is great (all the tarts are good quality). Service is ok, one lady senior staff member was very helpful, but it was difficult to get the attention of waiters at times. 

One gripe is the value, which is why I knocked a star off .Given that there's no semi-buffet option to help yourself, there isn't any seafood or counter food available. I know this is a government regulation but I don't think anything has been done to top up the tiered tea, to make up for the difference in value for customers. 

Overall, might return, but maybe only when they've started serving seafood or other food to complement the high tea tier again."

Our family love a Sunday lunch treat and our two girls under 4 (yep, save a prayer for us!) have become accustomed to it. The place for us is Tea Lounge@ Regent Singapore. 

The warmth and genuine welcome by Ramesh and the team sets us up for a wonderful luncheon experience.

Summer Palace,"Chinese, Asian",LimK358,5,"Regent has always been a charm that stood tall with time. I was at the Tea-Lounge with my mother on the 12th Nov 2020 for afternoon tea. Like before, the people there aren't just getting the service done. They are there to deliver their service passionately right. 

My family and I shared many good time with Regent. Our first family wedding banquet was held there more than 20 years ago. When I wae a teenager, I was provided with a long pants when I turned up in a berms for a lunch at Summer Palace. I brought my date for our first cocktail experience at the lounge. They sure are beautiful memories I have for Regent. 

Now, Ramesh and his wonderful team has made it again. I was having a private afternoon tea with my mother. Their attentivness had added more weights to my fond impression of this place. 

Every little effort made won't go unnoticed. They would just form a lovely memory that we share with family and friends, which you and your staff might never find out. 

In this challenging time, your consistency in delighting your guests in the most simple sincerity will not fail you. Is only a matter of time.

Thank you.

For those who are more interested in the material aspect, personally I was delighted by their choices especially the Finger Sandwiches spread. The savoury macaron is in my opinion, exotic. I like it when they have a cake stand for each guest and you may request for a second, third  serving on any of the items you fancy. That is generous as some places would only offer the less popular items for repeat serving. 

Thank you."
Summer Palace,"Chinese, Asian",ERIC L,5,"We had two excellent visits to the Tea Lounge @ Regent Singapore for weekend hi tea within 1 month, and here's why:
- the quality of food is great, one of the best we have tasted in hi tea buffets. If you are a Char Siew person, you have to try their rendition of this dish. We ordered three servings for just the two of us. The prawn & fish congee and the laksa are also great dishes that are worth a second helping.
- the service. This is truly commendable. Those of us who frequent buffets during this period will know that a buffet served to the table can be a disaster waiting to happen, with slow service, and often missed items. Not this restaurant, we were amazed at the speed of the service, the attention of all the staff and the joy on their faces whenever they approach us. This is a rare show of commitment to the job and to see everyone seemingly enjoying serving us, despite how much running around we could see them doing, just make us feel so much more special.
And in these times, such feelings are really hard to come by.

I must specially commend two of the staff of the Lounge (whom I managed to catch their names): Mr. Lim Chee Hao and Manager Ramesh. I can see how committed they are to their roles and how attentive they are to make sure that we don't wait long for our food. Ramesh's leadership is apparent and it shows in the morale of all the staff in this outlet.

A joy to taste the good food served, and an even greater joy to watch this orchestra in action!More"

The Korean and Japanese influence also makes this place quite different from the usual French, Japanese or Chinese on the top ranked list.  The wine pairing combines traditional wines with interesting sakes and Korean liqueurs.  The food is less spicy and robust than traditional Korean, relying on the natural flavor of the ingredients."

The sawara, jeju abalone, samegarei (fish), challans duck and BBQ wagyu short rib came in succession, followed by the desserts. The food cannot be faulted and of the mains, I liked the samegarei fish.

Tea Lounge at Regent Singapore,International,jesjohansen,5,For a Michelin starred restaurant the price here is entirely acceptable. It is not cheap but certainly worth it.

Meta Restaurant,"European, Asian",ashwinmram,5,"We actually had the food delivered for a gathering at our place, and Sam from Aromas of India did a great job helping me place the order.  He took a photo of the bill once finalized and I settled it through PayNow.

We tried the butter chicken, lamb roganjosh, malai kofta, palak paneer, and methi fish.  All the dishes were delicious and suitable for a foreign palette.  The fish was a bit dry and a bit tough in my opinion.

The roganjosh was a little spicy on certain bites, but the other dishes weren't spicy yet had lots of flavor.

The delivery fee was a flat S$10 which I felt was very fair considering food panda and other food delivery places in Singapore would not allow deliveries as far away as our place in Sengkang.

I've also eaten at the restaurant once in person before and had vegetarian food with naan that time.  The paneer butter masala and the daal we had were delicious and went very well with the naan.

The restaurant itself was relatively quiet, but we did see a lot of outbound deliveries."
Meta Restaurant,"European, Asian",daniel1834,5,The food served at Aromas is excellent. I keep visiting them occasionally with family and friends. Great taste too. üòä Their Gobi Manchurian is superb. Others don't come close.

Not too heavy, reasonably priced and finger lickin' good. We usually get our staple of paneer, bhindi and channa and they have never let us down. It has been consistently great. The service is equally amazing. The manager, Sam is super helpful, polite and always willing to go the extra mile. We have been getting home deliveries from from a while now and are glad they deliver island wide (at the time of writing this review). Highly recommended!More"

Meta Restaurant,"European, Asian",occs2018,4,"The Oakham Curry Club (OCC) is a well-respected Institution with multiple international 
Franchises. Thus review of ‚ÄòAroma of India ‚Äì The sweet smell of success‚Äô being the latest by our Singapore branch. The OCC takes pride in searching out the finest Indian restaurants and providing impartial reviews of Curry Houses all over the world. 
Members vote anonymously without being influenced by other members (we call this ‚Äúno 
swaying‚Äù) on 5 categories, and an average score out of a maximum 10 is given to each 
restaurant we review. For full transparency, see below scores (out of 10). The voting is based on the votes from OCC members. Restaurants must score an average of 7/10 or above to receive the OCC sticker of recommendation. All OCC members have been through a rigorous selection process to gain entry into the Club. In short, we all know our curries. 

Aroma of India 
Meet on the 27th August 2020: 60 Race Course Road. 218567 
Quality: 7.67 
Customer Care: 8.89 
Value: 8.44 
Service: 8.39 
Atmosphere: 6.5 
Overall: 7.98 

Aroma of India IS AWARDED the OCC badge of recommendation with atmosphere the only score coming in below 7 

‚ÄúAromas of India is a ""Theme Restaurant"" and our theme is ""Ultimate Client Satisfaction"". 
A distinguishing feature of the Aromas of India is its bright, family atmosphere in the daytime, transforming into an elegant brasserie in the evening.‚Äù 
Aromas of India had definitely nailed their colours to the mast that their theme is Ultimate Client Satisfaction so we went in expecting to be looked after. 
First impressions of the restaurant itself ‚Äì it is medium sized with plenty of space for socially distanced eating so no need to call the Korma Police on this lot. It is certainly brighter than most curry houses and actually quite chilly in there - not as cold as Singapore cinemas ‚Äì but cold enough that a second layer or some trousers wouldn‚Äôt have gone a miss. Having said that the welcome we received on arrival was very warm and we were immediately made to feel at home. 

‚ÄúPoppadoms with THREE sauces and bonus onion bhajis today to set us off!‚Äù 

‚Äúthe provision of sauce with poppadoms was the best I've seen‚Äù 
So we were off to a good start. The eagle eyed amongst us had eyed some beers taps but we were informed that they weren‚Äôt yet working. But the beers were soon flowing with regular rounds of cold bottles of Kingfisher arriving hastily at our table. 

‚ÄúMy glass was never short of beer, felt like a free flow!‚Äù

Anyway soon enough the starters soon arrived comprising of Samosas and a sizeable non-veg platter which a good selection of meat and seafood. One of our quieter members (despite playing the drums) is a vegetarian so the platter was big enough for the remaining 4 of us to share. 

‚ÄúI thought the starter were great. Generous portions of samosas. Personally I‚Äôm not a huge fan of seafood tandoori but the rest of it was delicious‚Äù 

‚ÄúTandoor platter was a bit dry apart from the lamb.‚Äù 

On to mains which were Yellow Dal, Channa Masala, Chicken Tikka, Jhal Frazi, Butter Chicken, Lamb Vindaloo, Bhuna Gosht and a lot Garlic Naans. 

‚ÄúThe curries were all spicy and delicious winners and the garlic naans were spectacular, maybe the best I‚Äôve ever naan I‚Äôve ever had.‚Äù

‚ÄúFantastic food. Incredible bread and vindaloo. I think maybe there was a bit of stinginess with the meat in the curries but a very very good meal.‚Äù 

‚ÄúButter chicken was outstanding as were the naans.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCurries were OK, but a bit samey.‚Äù

By the end of the meal there was very little left on the table (except a stray green chilli) and we had all eaten our fill. In the past the OCC has been a little shocked when receiving the bills but on this occasion it was about $80 per head which with many beers included is excellent value and this is reflected in the scores. 

‚ÄúAnd then the bill was very reasonable . Great great venue!‚Äù 

As a club we want to give special praise to the staff who went over and above not only in terms of service but also customer care, one highlight being the provision of free shots to an esteemed member who had recently turned 40. 

‚ÄúThe manager could not do enough for us service stood out here.‚Äú 

‚ÄúVery good service. Great customer care.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCustomer Care better than the actual curry.‚Äù 

‚ÄúVery impressed. Service and customer care really stood out, though a bit suspicious that they knew what we were all about and stepped up their game. But after all we are the OCC and deserve nothing less!‚Äù 

Final reflections on Aroma of India. The website claims that a guest is compared with the presence of God. Our chairman is actually convinced that God is a DJ which is why he couldn‚Äôt attend, instead opting to ‚Äòchase the vibes‚Äô on an 18-30s holiday in Ibiza. However I‚Äôm sure he will be disappointed to have missed this 

‚ÄúAlthough not a date night restaurant, if you‚Äôre looking for good food and great service you can‚Äôt really go wrong.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe customer care and value was pretty damn good for what was, all in a very decent curry. Not one for date night, but for a curry and a pint, I‚Äôm in!‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat a tremendous curry house‚ÄùMore"
Meta Restaurant,"European, Asian",NigelG407,5,"My first time back to Aromas since the restrictions were lifted. Restaurant has been nicely refurbished and repainted - it looks more spacious now, but that may just be the social distancing requirement.

Merci Marcel,"French, Cafe",Y880,4,This cosy Michelin star restaurant is perfect for satisfying one‚Äôs craving for traditional French meal with fine wines and an amazing selection of cheeses.
Merci Marcel,"French, Cafe",adrianwn,5,"One of the best fine dining experience which we ever had in Singapore. There is a reason why they are still here after all these years. The meal was delicious. The service was fantastic. It is a bit pricey, but basically you get what you paid for. A great choice for celebrations and special occasions."
Merci Marcel,"French, Cafe",JumboTraveller,5,"I had high expectations going into this dinner.  I'm not a big believer in the erratic and seemingly bias Michelin star system but had heard enough strong reviews to give it a try.  I was willing to spend the cash for a luxury culinary experience (end bill was $1.2k+/2p) but expected a lot.  Les Amis delivered on service, food quality/taste and ambience.  

This is not an easy task during the height of the COVID 19 pandemic.  So kudos to Les Amis for such deft handling.  

We had the smaller (4 course) degustation menu.  It was enough food - the additional amuse bouche dishes and the richness of the food ensured that.  The food quality, presentation and taste were high - I think I said ""Wow"" for almost every dish.  

Again, this is a special occasion venue (unless the company is paying!!).  Otherwise hard to justify spending over a grand for a meal for 2p.

NB: I ate at the old CePage in HK (years ago when it was still open) and that place was terrible and a rip off."
Merci Marcel,"French, Cafe",MigLiew,2,"was prepared to spend at this not-cheap establishment so 5-course menu price didn‚Äôt surprise me to begin with.

the mezzanine where we‚Äôre seated were quite stuffy as warm air gushes in every time the door was opened. (so try avoiding mezz if possible). food was ok throughout but nothing really stands out, with a 3 star michelin rating one‚Äôs expectation would be high however that seems rather mediocre.

service wise was really below average. both servers & sommelier seems rather transactional and wasn‚Äôt engaged despite briefly introducing the dishes. one lovely offering was the huge chunk of 125g butter created large to retain moisture and taste, but 120g unconsumed butter just went into food wastage unfortunately.

they say ‚Äòclothes make the man‚Äô & in terms of fine dining i would suggest ‚Äòexperience completes the dinner‚Äô. unfortunately the experience was very flat and forgettable.

for a 4-digit spend one can easily find a better experience at fraction of the price. 

Les Amis team surely you guys can do better and i look forward to return one day!More"

Les Amis is an old school French restaurant in Singapore. And there lies the rub. If you live in a French city, like we do, Les Amis is good, even very good. But wildly overpriced."

Merci Marcel,"French, Cafe",LambieG,4,"Comparing its league as ‚ÄòM‚Äô star holder restaurants, I find there are many under/over rated discrepancies. Citing some examples from Oz or even Europe like Vun in Italy with just 1 star is WAY better! Not sure if I have a different expectation or what ..to be fair food quality is great, no questions but then again it have to be! Since the price levels are above moderate. Service is what it has to be, if put in contrast with those 1 star in Europe, service levels has plenty of room for improvement. Just my own opinion.. good to try once, wont be back. But for those in Europe with the ‚ÄòM‚Äô stars we definitely will be back again as soon as COVID-19-free traveling resumes!More"

It is expensive but worth the price you pay."
Merci Marcel,"French, Cafe",748joeypat,3,"Main courses were shockingly disappointing for a 2 Michelin star restaurant. Several good items but not enough to salvage a mediocre lunch. I would rate the mains as poor and the desserts as 5 stars, so overall an average rating.

Merci Marcel,"French, Cafe",KCrC2011,5,This was a special treat for us to visit a Michelin star restaurant. The staff were very friendly and the service was great. We went for lunch and the food was fabulous! It was worth the cost.
Merci Marcel,"French, Cafe",Peter1252mg,5,"Les Amis is one of the more well known fine dining restaurants in Singapore.

Merci Marcel,"French, Cafe",bcheong,5,"Opened in the 1990s, this stalwart of fine/french cuisine in singapore is still doing well and got some michelin stars.

Merci Marcel,"French, Cafe",LamN_12,4,"Dining at Les Amis is always a pleasure, from the smooth service to the quality of the cooking.

Merci Marcel,"French, Cafe",phattoey,2,We were there just last week. Food was good and wine selection was great. The French waiter seems to be quite arrogant. It was very difficult to understand what he said due to his English proficiency.
Merci Marcel,"French, Cafe",robincheesg,5,"Went there for a celebration.  Although when writing in to accommodate our food allergies, they said they could not, we decided to go anyway.  The staff were more than willing to help with our food allergies and everything turned out great.  Superb food and service ."
Merci Marcel,"French, Cafe",Tom M,4,We had a great dinner last night and really enjoyed the food and service. When we walked in I was a little concerned as the place wasn‚Äôt too full and the space is a little unusual in a ground floor space in an older office More
Merci Marcel,"French, Cafe",MartinandNarelle,5,The attention we received was outstanding the food was as good as it gets and the wine list goes on forever.  If you are in Singapore this I think would have to be one of the best restaurants to visit I started with the  langoustine More

Merci Marcel,"French, Cafe",jamessW8845DN,4,We were very excited to get a reservation at this restaurant as it is hard generally to secure a table. The restaurant is small inside and the staff very welcome in as we arrived. We were seated at a table and then they proceeded to More

Les Amis,French,MandyL077,2,"My family and I visited this cafe for brunch as we googled online and it seems generally pleasant. 

Foodwise was ok. Attentiveness to customer and the service rendered was unacceptable. 

Most of the tables for four was full and left with mainly two seaters table .We chose a table of four to dine with plates and drinks uncleared. The staff saw us walking and chose a table to sit on. We requested for our tables to be cleared but no action taken. 

We have to clear the tables ourselves and have to request for a wet cloth to wipe the table, which eventually, the staff came over to wipe it. 

Food was served to us with disgruntled attitude. 

Would not recommend this cafe should you prefer to have pleasant customer experience. There are probably other nicer cafes around the same area."
Les Amis,French,bcheong,3,"This chain started as a single bread shop in river valley and expanded. Nice breads, pastries, desserts and full meals. Pricey, but maybe the norm in singapore"

Les Amis,French,cynwong63,4,"In SG for a short getaway and went to Vivocity. Didn't know what to eat and hubs pointed out the artisanal cafe and asked if we could try it. I didn't say no although I only expected just regular service and mediocre food, and there were flies in there (maybe due to the open door concept?). Ordered the Garlic Prawn Marinara and a flat white, and hubs had the Eggs Benedict with Salmon and a latte. Took back my words because the whole experience exceeded my expectations. The food was WOW. The coffee was awesome. The service was..well I expected just regular as they were busy, but apparently that didn't hinder them because I got genuine smiles and greetings from the Malay lady at the counter and from the tomboyish staff who made our drinks and the Chinese man who sent them to our table. Went in hungry and left feeling so blissly full we wanted to sleep. Thumbs up to the team in that outlet, and thumbs up to the company for training them right!More"
Les Amis,French,NAZBUSA,1,"My wife and I had the worst egg Benedict. We were craving for a good and healthy fibre rich food . We googled and decided to walk in to this restaurant. the menu looked so appealing. Firstly would like to comment on the eggs Benedict as it is nothing like the picture. Our spinach was missing and the hollandaise sauce was dried up. The salmon was not fresh as u can see from the colour. Called the waiter and asked him is there something missing? And he went back to the kitchen and simply said ""oh yes we run out of spinach."" So no service recovery on this eg: didn't check whether we would like to change to something else or at least could have replace with a salad. No nothing at all. And then I realise there were also flies flying around and their display is not shut with the sliding door. And their tongs which they should be handling food is placed on the counter where there is flies around. They need to improve on sanitizing their work area."

The Red Rice bowl is my go-to; great flavour but on the healthier side, with a good mix of veggies and scrambled egg.

Les Amis,French,NAZBUSA,1,"My wife and I had the worst egg Benedict. We were craving for a good and healthy fibre rich food . We googled and decided to walk in to this restaurant. the menu looked so appealing. Firstly would like to comment on the eggs Benedict as it is nothing like the picture. Our spinach was missing and the hollandaise sauce was dried up. The salmon was not fresh as u can see from the colour. Called the waiter and asked him is there something missing? And he went back to the kitchen and simply said ""oh yes we run out of spinach."" So no service recovery on this eg: didn't check whether we would like to change to something else or at least could have replace with a salad. No nothing at all. And then I realise there were also flies flying around and their display is not shut with the sliding door. And their tongs which they should be handling food is placed on the counter where there is flies around. They need to improve on sanitizing their work area."

Les Amis,French,MandyL077,2,"My family and I visited this cafe for brunch as we googled online and it seems generally pleasant. 

Foodwise was ok. Attentiveness to customer and the service rendered was unacceptable. 

Most of the tables for four was full and left with mainly two seaters table .We chose a table of four to dine with plates and drinks uncleared. The staff saw us walking and chose a table to sit on. We requested for our tables to be cleared but no action taken. 

We have to clear the tables ourselves and have to request for a wet cloth to wipe the table, which eventually, the staff came over to wipe it. 

Food was served to us with disgruntled attitude. 

Would not recommend this cafe should you prefer to have pleasant customer experience. There are probably other nicer cafes around the same area."

Artisan Boulangerie Co.,Cafe,CheffaSing,5,"Had lunch with my wife at the Tippling Club last Friday having the 10 courses lunch set. Every dish was just amazing explosion of flavours and textures, so much details in every dish and amazingly well executed despite the complexity of each one. At no point we felt overwhelmed by the food. Every dish was precise in flavours and textures. This service was also very prompt and precise kudos to the team hope to see you rise high. We really enjoyed and will be back!More"
Artisan Boulangerie Co.,Cafe,Nymphsis,4,"Tippling Club is split between two sides, one where you drink, and the dining area. Naturally, I'm in the drinking area.

The atmosphere is chic and fun in a laid-back manner, a simple drink menu to choose from, and some pretty great bar snacks to enjoy with the drinks.

I've managed to try 2 cocktails, a side order of pastrami sandwich and some fries (which my friend said is a must). It was a good thing for me, though having shared half of the sandwich with my friend, it goes so so well with drinks, I love how the pickle that comes with it, elevate the 'jelat-ness' of the single flavor pastrami (though I did have a silent wish that the bread was sourdough haha ü§£)

The fries (lamb westons fries), now that is really great finger food. Its good on its own with the fried capers or with their bloody Mary sauce. I could not really taste the bloody Mary in the sauce, but then again, it could be all the alcohol that night after bar-hopping about  

The bar closes by 1030pm due to COVID-19, however, this would also me a that you'd have to finish your drinks by 1030pm if not it will be cleared off. 

Nonetheless, the place is worth going back to!More"
Artisan Boulangerie Co.,Cafe,Guinness68,3,"Some of the courses were great, e.g. ceviche, but most were just okay, e.g. john dory was over done, beef was fine.  I would say this was a decent experience but for the price compared to other restaurants in the same price range, it did not live up to expectations.  The dishes were just not exceptional. We went for lunch so maybe the dinner is better.  The staff were very friendly.  Chef was there (and we sat at the counter overlooking the kitchen) but he did not greet us?  hmmm."
Artisan Boulangerie Co.,Cafe,bschmittling,5,Took my wife here as a surprise and it was one of the most memorable meals I've had in Singapore. Such unique dishes with an inventive cocktail menu - something for everyone. I may not be able to eat here all the time but for a special occasion it's definitely worth it.
Artisan Boulangerie Co.,Cafe,TravelwithmeAT,5,"We had a lovely meal here, so much food on the tasting menu and very generous with the drinks too! Service is top notch, the sommelier is knowledgeable, and the vibe is trendy. There is such a shortage of these sorts of places in Singapore!"
Artisan Boulangerie Co.,Cafe,KGB777,3,"We came here on a weeknight in early March to try the cocktails and to tick off the bar from the Asia Top 50 list (having already been to most of the others in Singapore). But somehow the Tippling Club didn't quite have the ambience of the other cocktail bars - perhaps because it is really a restaurant, and the bar is kind of an after-thought. Compared to the Old Man and Junior, which we had visited earlier in the same evening, this just didn't compare in terms of quality, enthusiasm of the staff, or ambience. If I return to Tippling Club I will make a point of trying the food and leave the cocktail bar experience for other places."
Artisan Boulangerie Co.,Cafe,atl_trav917,5,"I had the classic menu (with extra cheese course), a cocktail and two glasses of wine.  While not every course was a home run, all were very creative and most were exceptional. Was expensive for Singapore, but when you add up the various amuse bouches and dessert courses, it is not bad for the money and if you are interested in creative food and a memorable experience, very much worth the splurge.  Service was attentive without being rushed.  Highly recommend and was particularly a great change of pace after 2 weeks of all Asian food."
Artisan Boulangerie Co.,Cafe,eat-wander-repeat,5,"Bespoke cocktails and cuisine inspired by the French chef Escoffier. A modern, innovative take on classic french dishes and techniques with Asian inspired flair - we stopped in her on the way back to the hotel after dinner and what a delight! The staff were helpful, informed and friendly and the drinks - White Truffles in Winter and the Banh Mi Sazerac - were amazing! If we'd known before or had more time in Singapore we definitely would've booked a proper dinner here as everything demonstrated a real passion behind the inspiration of this place. Put it on the list."

Takeshi Noodle Bar,"Japanese, Asian",rikutm,5,Good food. Great views. Good service. Little on the expensive side. Have gone twice for business lunch with set menu with nice options to choose from.
Takeshi Noodle Bar,"Japanese, Asian",Globa1Foodie,2,"We just had lunch at Jaan. The food was pretty good (with nice surprises and good portions overall), but not fantastic. The views of the bay were great though. A few things detracted from our experience. When we approaced the reception desk, the person asked us in a very rude voice, ""You have a reservation at Jaan?"" I guess something about our apperance gave her the impression that we weren't the type of people who would make a reservation at Jaan. Next, we found that the regular 4 course menu that's mentioned on their website was not available today. At least they should have mentioned on their website and/or in an email or SMS that only more expensive options are available today. Then we would have chosen to come on another day. We were forced to pay 33% extra for one small portion. This was basically deceptive. And on top of that, they charged for water."
Takeshi Noodle Bar,"Japanese, Asian",lingdohkin,1,"I booked a table for lunch through Jaan‚Äôs website 6 weeks in advance to celebrate the much anticipated anniversary. The reservation was confirmed via email on Nov 17. I received a call two weeks before the lunch informing me that the restaurant will be closed on the day of my booking. Prior reservation was ‚Äúa system error‚Äù. The caller‚Äôs tone was unapologetic. Citing that the call was a courtesy from the restaurant trying to make other arrangements. But, what choice do I have? Move my anniversary date? Appalled by the service, truly disappointed."
Takeshi Noodle Bar,"Japanese, Asian",32lesb,1,Day before our anniversary lunch they rang and cancelled our booking ‚Äúsystem error‚Äù was the excuse. Please book again   simply awful service   We‚Äôre going elsewhere
Takeshi Noodle Bar,"Japanese, Asian",davidcottle,5,"JAAN's food, wine and service are all so fine that one feels the good people at Michelin are being very grudging. If the quality I experienced can be sustained then another star must be about the surest bet in fine dining right now.

Superb value for what you get. There are great views too, but, once service starts, you'll barely care. This place could be in a third-level sub basement and I'd still happily queue to get in.

Stop reading this. Ask them nicely for a table."
Takeshi Noodle Bar,"Japanese, Asian",melmanprohero,5,"Wife and i celebrated our wedding anniversary at Jaan and it was a great experience. 
While it may seem pricey , but for the quality of the food , attentive service , and awesome location , i think it is well worth it . 
Make Jaan your go to restaurant for the special occasions."
Takeshi Noodle Bar,"Japanese, Asian",asiajusta,4,Superb food. Excellent wine list and sommelier. Service levels top notch. We didn‚Äôt get the window seating we asked for but it wasn‚Äôt an issue as (sadly) nobody got a view based on the windows being misted up. Little bit cheeky slipping in the cheese board pre dessert as I wasn‚Äôt aware it was extra but again it was superb quality so all‚Äôs well. The prices will hit your pocket hard but you get what you pay for and as dining experiences go in Singapore this is one of the best for sure.
Takeshi Noodle Bar,"Japanese, Asian",louise_kz300,4,"Great food with strong flavours, love all the links to Devon and Cornwall. Amazing bread which we were given a second loaf of to take home.

Takeshi Noodle Bar,"Japanese, Asian",FJB774,5,"I booked the restaurant on line in late July for a birthday in late September.  I didn't hear a thing as follow up  I started trying to chase up in August and did not discover any successful method.  For example Voice mail box was full every single time.
We booked another restaurant but 2 days before out of the blue --bingo a confirmation.  From thereon it it was a dream connecting with them.  The attention to detail, service, presentation of the food was exceptional.
The view was phenomenal, the wine pairing excellent and the service and attention by the Italian sommelier outstanding.
Highlights the egg within an egg, the langoustine and the pigeon were delightful.
An excellent place and while not cheap was not as expensive as some."
Takeshi Noodle Bar,"Japanese, Asian",Mike W,5,"I have eaten three times at JAAN under Kirk Westaway. The food is truly superb and beautifully presented. At S$110++ the set lunch comes with many pre and post meal goodies and is a lot better value than the now very expensive Les Amis and Odette. 

My only gripe, we have never secured a table by the window. Perhaps you have to book months in advance."

A simple lunch which I planned to have just to be away from the beach, turned to be special, just because of this special request. It really made me feel like I was in another city, and it made me de-stress from all my work-woes.

Empress,"Chinese, Singaporean",HappyBelly,3,"Went here for lunch. Food was good, the beef was extremely tender, you didn't need a knife.  Bread with 2 different salts (rosemary and saffron) and French butter is a winner. 4 wine selections by the glass, all reasonably priced and good.

Service was passive-aggressive .Walked in, no one there to greet us, and a waiter muttered ""it's not my job"", so we waited a few more minutes. Waters (paid for sparkling) never topped up. Unenergetic explanation of the cheese trolley such as ""the cheeses are almost the same, it doesn't matter what you get."" It felt like the staff was unhappy and taking it out on their customers -- doing the minimum and not putting heart into their work.

We felt the place lacked soul. The food is good, but there are other restaurants in Singapore where the chef and wait staff are happy to serve their customers."

Fleur De Sel Le Restaurant,"French, European",I6265EDjohnt,4,"First time trying this place cos there is just so many Ramen restaurants in Spore. I ordered the Original And my wife ordered the Green Ramen I am not a big fan of Pesto but I actually liked the green ramen broth.. didn‚Äôt expect pesto & tonkatsu broth to blend so well

As for my own bowl I maxed all the flavours with spice level 6 which was a good Balance not too spicy ..I could probably do a level 8-9 or maybe even a 10. The tonkatsu broth is rich and with the added garlic & chopped spring onions it really help cuts the fatty broth. The char Siu was a bit too lean so I preferred the pork belly that wasn‚Äôt too fatty which was great. Really nothing to complain about.
