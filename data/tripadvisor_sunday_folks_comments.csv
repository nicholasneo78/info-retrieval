angelachen1910,4,"When we arrived for our appointment/ booking the staff was really friendly and polite! The food however, understandably took a while to come as it was really busy. We ordered the waffle with Gula Melaka Sea-salt ice cream and while that part of the dessert was great, it started to get cloying sweet despite myself having a sweet tooth. The watermelon lime pop was rather disappointing as it tasted like really sour lime soda with no hint of watermelon in spite of the watermelon chunks placed inside - we expected a watermelon base with hints of lime as with most places. - Really recommend their hot chocolate though!More","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
smhisham,5,"Love every dessert ordered, even the coffee, A-awesome. Gotta say the service by these two girls who seemed to look alike was superb.","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
Alex A,5,Superb service and excellent waffles and ice cream! Cozy ambience. Best place to spend a lazy indulgent Sunday!,"['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
ZhenJing A,5,Enjoy our Sunday afternoon with the Yummy waffles and ice creams! Worth to visit but too bad the pistachio flavor has discontinued,"['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
Jenny Y,5,Love the earl grey lavender ice cream sits on top of single waffle with fresh strawberries. Dark choco ferrero is amazing too!,"['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
sowmyai5,3,"I have been to Sunday Folks before and have enjoyed my time but sadly, this time round was a huge let down. They no longer have the pistachio and vanilla flavours, the soft serve is hollow inside (they just make a large outside cone so they essentially give less ice cream than before) and they don't even give it on the thin chocolate wafers anymore, but rather just a dull marie biscuit. The taste overall also seemed rather lackluster and just was not worth the price.","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
darkhonour,5,"I visited Sunday Folks as they had the kaya toast ice cream special. The cafe only opens on Friday, Saturday and Sunday and the crowd builds up early on (they open at 1pm). If you do not like crowds and are alone, you should consider to come on Friday during opening time. (It is really busy after 1.30pm even on Friday, let alone the weekend) - which is why I made a reservation in the first place!

The staff at the cafe exemplifies good service standards which stands out from similar cafes in Singapore. I have been to cafes where they are much pricier than Sunday Folks yet do not practise good service quality.

I will definitely be back for a repeat visit, especially if they have some new upcoming special!More","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
Marcusmeow,5,"Went here for a high tea session with friends and was pleasantly greeted with nice ambience and their Dark Chocolate Ferrero ice cream which is made with delicious 55% dark couverture chocolate and fragrant hazelnut paste. Every luscious swirl is bursting with cocoa flavours and hints of roasted hazelnuts. On top of it, there is also caramel marshmallows, chocolate hazelnut sauce and more roasted hazelnuts for a truly indulgent treat!More","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
princesspreets,4,"we were really looking forward to waffles, but were so sad to find out that the menu has been changed and there's no waffles right now! the churros were good, but as they were sugar coated, felt that it adds up to too much sugar overdose as the icecreams and toppings are all mostly very sweet too. would be good to have a more balanced menu/offering. great service and attitude from all the staff as alwaysMore","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
Cera K,4,"Was excited to go back for their signature waffle with ice-cream. Only to discover that waffles had been removed from menu! So sad! Waffles was replace by Chuffles (cinnamon flavoured, fried waffles strips?). Thankful it was yummy but sinful ","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
insertnamerighthere,5,"They do soft serve ice cream really well! one of the fewer places that do soft serve. I lovee their flavours - earl grey lavender, roasted pistachio! waffle is a really warm, crispy stack.","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
pingguo301,4,"Crispy waffles and yummy soft serve (we tried earl grey lavender and roasted pistachio flavors). The toppings were all good, though the sea salt chocolate honeycomb was abit overwhelming in sweetness. Try to go before 8pm, coz that’s when the crowd comes in.","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
pauljer,5,"Singapore’s dessert scene is anything but boring. I remember when going out for a mid-afternoon sweet treat was about choosing between a red velvet or a chocolate cupcake. These days it’s a whole other story. Desserts have been supersized, with enough calories to fuel a More","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
AndyCworld,1,So much for open until 11pm. Traveled across town to order a waffle cone and was told at 10:35pm they already had “last call” for waffles. Never heard of a restaurant stopping to serve food before they close. Should advertise 1030pm close if you don’t More,"['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
Pukimon97,5,"Been here for a few times and I really love there waffles, especially the lavender flavoured one! A good place to chill.","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
adrickh2018,4,Waffle is yummy. We ordered tiramisu cake as well. The cake is so so. It is good to see that they now accept credit card. Very crowded on a Saturday afternoon.,"['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
SarahC11639,3,"Sadly not as great as I remembered. The waffles were pretty measly & small, not that crisp. Plus the toppings were really little  for the price we paid we expected a lot more tbh. The ice cream servings were quite little too. Probably won't be More","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
64xinyuc,4,Booked via chope but the downside is the minimum spending of $10 per pax. Realised that other tables did not follow this rule and the staff did not really enforce it. Silly us obeyed dutifully and stuffed ourselves silly,"['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
scottkjphotography,5,"A pleasant dessert experience here at Sunday Folks.

Avoid waiting by visiting during their off peak period.

WinnieN107,5,"Visited Sunday Folks on a weekday around 4pm. You can lesser crowd compared to after lunch or weekends. Not too sure about evenings.  First visit. Have heard about their tasty waffles but since I’m alone, and I saw a soufflé cake, I simply can’t wait More","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
371DanielL,4,"Looking for a fantastic ice cream, waffles & gula melaka, but waiting time, either for queues or foods is terrible! You need to have your time.","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
grace t,4,"Who doesn’t love rich flavourful creamy ice cream on a nice warm waffle beautifully decorated ? The Milo Dinosaur on a crispy cone was really yummy too.
Lots of young people and we needed to wait in a queue.
Rather noisy but a hip place More","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
ivory4elephant,5,"Always come back for their Sea Salt Gula Melaka Ice Cream with Waffles. Can never get enough of it! But the queue can be really long during peak hours. If you wanna avoid the crowd and queue, you can consider coming before tea breaks right More","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
Manaty,1,"So disappointed from their service   
Most customers look students so they don’t bother a quality services. The staff are don’t bother any new customer so no assist in how to order.   The dessert look tummy though ☺️
I think this cafe is for students .","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
Tour54533,4,"Great place to hangout. Went around 5pm and there was no crowd, unlike peak hours. So wait was short and place was spacious.","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
manaty12,1,"Their level of service has no standard.  The staff are no energy to serve customers.  The dessert is just normal. Not super fantastic.  One time is enough.  
 
まずサービスがまったくないです。　普通のカフェ。その割には高い値段のアイスクリームを提供してます。　お味は普通です。期待するほどでもなし。ハーゲンダッツのアイスで十分です。","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
tagohHS,5,"Ordered earl grey their signature ice cream with waffle and it’s extremely worth it. Priced at $11.50++ and you won’t regret.

Highly recommend all to try, they do serve cakes too.","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
Stella T,2,"We were pretty excited to try the soft serve at Sunday Folks and the crowd and lines only raised our expectations. Unfortunately, the actual products failed to deliver for us.

We had the salted gula melaka cone and the dark chocolate cones. I thought the More","['Dessert', 'Cafe']",Sunday Folks
